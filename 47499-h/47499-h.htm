<p class='c012'>To whom can a work which professes to blend amusement with
instruction, be dedicated with so much propriety, as to one, whose
numerous writings have satisfactorily demonstrated the practicability
and value of such a union;--to one, who has stripped Romance of her
meretricious trappings, and converted her theatre into a temple worthy
of Minerva? Justly has it been observed, that to the magic pens of
Madame D’Arblay and yourself we are indebted for having the Novel
restored to its consequence, and, therefore, to its usefulness; and I
may be allowed to add, that your Harry and Lucy has shown how
profitably, and agreeably, the machinery of fiction may be worked for
the dissemination of truth.</p>

serviceable to the commonwealth, may be long extended, and deservedly
enjoyed, is the fervent wish of</p>

  <h2 class='c009'>TO THE READER.</h2>
<hr class='c015' />
<p class='c016'>Tell me, gentle Reader, whether thou hast not heard of the box of
Pandora, which was no sooner opened by the unhappy Epimetheus, than it
gave flight to a troop of malevolent spirits, which have ever since
tormented the human race.--Behold!--I here present you with a magic
casket, containing a GENIUS alone capable of counteracting their
direful spells. Thou mayest, perhaps, say that its aspect but ill
accords with the richness of its promised treasure; so appeared the
copper vessel found by the fisherman, as related in the Arabian tale;
but, remember, that no sooner had he broken its mystic seal, than the
imprisoned genius spread itself over the ocean and raised its giant
limbs above the clouds. But this was an evil and treacherous spirit;
mine is as benevolent as he is mighty, and seeks communion with our
race for no other object than to render mortals virtuous and happy. To
be plain, for you must already, my young friends, have unriddled my
allegory, his name is <span class='sc'>Philosophy</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'>In your progress through life, be not so vain as to believe that you
will escape the evils with which its path is beset. Arm yourselves,
therefore, with the talisman that can, at once, deprive adversity of
its sting, and prosperity of its dangers; for such, believe me, is the
rare privilege of philosophy.</p>

<p class='c016'>I must now take leave of you, for a short time, in order that I may
address a few words to your parents and preceptors; but, as I have no
plot to abridge your liberties, or lengthen your hours of study, you
may listen to my address without alarm, and to my plan without
suspicion. Imagine not, however, that I shall recommend the dismissal
of the cane, or the whip; on the contrary, I shall insist upon them as
necessary and indispensable instruments for the accomplishment of my
design. But the method of applying them will be changed; with the one
I shall construct the bow of the kite, with the other I shall spin the
top.</p>

<p class='c016'>The object of the present work is to inculcate that early love of
science which can never be derived from the sterner productions. Youth
is naturally addicted to amusement, and in this item his expenditure
too often exceeds his allotted income. I have, therefore, taken the
liberty to draw a draft upon Philosophy, with the full assurance that
it will be gratefully repaid, with compound interest, ten years after
date. But to be serious; those who superintend the education of youth
should be apprised of the great importance of the first impressions.
Rousseau has said, that the seeds of future vices or virtues are more
frequently sown by the mother than the tutor; thereby intimating, that
the characters of men are often determined by the earliest
impressions; and, of so much moment did Quintillian regard this truth,
that he recommends to us the example of Philip, who did not suffer any
other than Aristotle to teach Alexander to read. In
like manner those who do not commence their study of nature at an early
season, will afterwards have many unnecessary obstacles to encounter.
The difficulty of comprehending the principles of Natural Philosophy
frequently arises from their being at variance with those false ideas
which early associations have impressed upon the mind; the first years
of study are, therefore, expended in <i>un</i>learning, and in clearing
away the weeds, which would never have taken root in a properly
cultivated soil. Writers on practical education have repeatedly
advocated the advantages of the plan I am so anxious to enforce; but,
strange to say, it is only within a few years that any works have
appeared at all calculated to afford the necessary assistance. In
short, previous to the labours of Mrs. Marcet and Miss Edgeworth, the
productions published for the purpose of juvenile instruction may be
justly charged with the grossest errors; and must have proved as
destructive to the mind of the young reader, as the book presented by
the physician Douban is said to have been to the Grecian king, who, as
the Arabian tale relates, imbibed fresh poison as he turned over each
leaf, until he fell lifeless in the presence of his courtiers; or, to
give another illustration, as mischievous as the magic volume of
Michael Scott, which, as Dempster informs us, could not be opened
without the danger of invoking some malignant fiend by the operation.
How infinitely superior in execution and purpose are the juvenile
works of the present century!--to borrow a metaphor from Coleridge,
they may be truly said to resemble a collection
of mirrors set in the same frame, each having its own focus of knowledge,
yet all capable of converging to one point.</p>

<p class='c016'>Allow me, friendly Reader, before I conclude my address, to say a few
words upon the plan and execution of the work before you. It is not
intended to supersede or clash with any of the elementary treatises to
which I have alluded; indeed its plan is so peculiar, that I apprehend
such a charge cannot be brought against it. The author originally
composed it for the exclusive use of his children, and would certainly
never have consigned it to the press, but at the earnest solicitations
of those friends upon whose judgment he places the utmost reliance.
Let this be received as an answer to those, who, believing that they
can recognise the writer, may be induced to exclaim with Menedemus in
Terence,--“<i>Tantumne est ab re tuâ otii tibi aliena ut cures, eaque
nihil quæ ad te attinent?</i>” <a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c017'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c016'>It is scarcely necessary to offer any apology for the conversational
plan of instruction; the success of Mrs. Marcet’s dialogues has placed
its value beyond dispute. It may, however, be observed, that this
species of composition may be executed in two different ways, either
as direct conversation, where none but the speakers appear, which is
the method used by Plato; or as the recital of a conversation, where
the author himself appears, and gives an account of what passed in
discourse, which is the plan generally adopted by
Cicero. The reader is aware, that Mrs. Marcet, in her “Conversations on
Philosophy,” has adopted the former, while Miss Edgeworth, in her
“Harry and Lucy,” has preferred the latter method. In composing the
present work I have followed the plan of the last-mentioned authoress.
Its advantages over the more direct conversational style appear to
consist in allowing occasional remarks, which come more aptly from the
author than from any of the characters engaged in the dialogue.</p>

<p class='c016'>If scientific dialogues are less popular in our times than they were
in ancient days, it must be attributed to the frigid and insipid
manner in which they have too frequently been executed; if we except
the mere external forms of conversation, and that one character is
made to speak, and the other to answer, they are altogether the same
as if the author himself spoke throughout the whole, instead of
amusing with a varied style of conversation, and with a display of
consistent and well-supported characters. The introduction of a person
of humour, to enliven the discourse, is sanctioned by the highest
authority. Cæsar is thus introduced by Cicero, and Cynthio by Addison.
In the introduction of Mr. Twaddleton and Major Snapwell, I am well
aware of the criticisms to which I am exposed; I have exercised my
fancy with a freedom and latitude, for which, probably, there is not
any precedent in a scientific work. I have even ventured so far to
deviate from the beaten track as to skirmish upon the frontiers of the
Novelist, and to bring off captive some of the artillery of Romance;
but if, by so doing, I have enhanced the interest of my work, and
furthered the accomplishment of its object, let me intreat that mere
novelty may not be urged to its disparagement. The antiquarian Vicar,
however, will, I trust, meet with cordial reception from the classical
student. As to Ned Hopkins, although he may not bear a comparison with
William Summers, the fool of Henry VIII.--or with Richard Tarlton, who
“<i>undumpished</i> Queen Elizabeth at his pleasure;” or with Archibald
Armstrong (vulgo <i>Archee</i>) Jester to Charles,--yet I will maintain, in
spite of the Vicar’s censure, that he is a right merry fellow, and to
the Major, and consequently to our history, a most important
accessary.</p>

<p class='c016'>If it be argued that several of my comic representations are
calculated, like seasoning, to stimulate the palate of the
novel-reader, rather than to nourish the minds of the younger class,
for whom the work was written, I might, were I so disposed, plead
common usage; for does not the director of a juvenile fête courteously
introduce a few piquant dishes, for the entertainment of those elder
personages who may attend in the character of a chaperone? You surely
could not deny me the full benefit of such a precedent; and so, Gentle
Reader, I bid thee--Farewell!</p>

<p class='c024'>The summer recess of Mr. Pearson’s school was not more anxiously
anticipated by the scholars than it was by the numerous family of
Seymour, who, at the commencement of the year, had parted from a
beloved son and brother for the first time. As the season of
relaxation approached, so did the inmates of Overton Lodge (for such
was the name of Mr. Seymour’s seat) betray increasing impatience for
its arrival. The three elder sisters, Louisa, Fanny, and Rosa, had
been engaged for several days in arranging the little study which
their brother Tom had usually occupied. His books were carefully
replaced on their shelves, and bunches of roses and jasmines, which
the affectionate girls had culled from the finest trees in the
<span class='pageno' title='2' id='Page_2'></span>garden, were tastefully dispersed through the apartment; the festoons of blue
ribbons, with which they were entwined, at once announced themselves
as the work of graceful hands, impelled by light hearts; and every
flower might be said to reflect from its glowing petals the smiles
with which it had been collected and arranged. At length the happy day
arrived; a post-chaise drew up to the front gate, and Tom was once
again folded in the arms of his affectionate and delighted parents.
The little group surrounded their beloved brother, and welcomed his
return with all the warmth and artlessness of juvenile sincerity.
“Well,” said Mr. Seymour, “if the improvement of your mind corresponds
with that of your looks, I shall indeed have reason to congratulate
myself upon the choice of your school. But have you brought me any
letter from Mr. Pearson?” “I have,” replied Tom, who presented his
father with a note from his master, in which he had commented, in high
terms of commendation, not only upon Tom’s general conduct, but upon
the rapid progress which he had made in his classical studies.</p>

<p class='c016'>“My dearest boy,” exclaimed the delighted father, “I am more than
repaid for the many anxious moments which I have passed on your
account. I find that your conduct has given the highest satisfaction
to your master; and that your good-nature, generosity, and, above all,
your strict adherence to truth, have ensured the love and esteem of
your school-fellows.” This gratifying report brought tears of joy into
the eyes of Mrs. Seymour; Tom’s cheek glowed with the feeling of
conscious merit; and the sisters interchanged looks of mutual
satisfaction. Can there be an incentive to industry and virtuous
conduct so powerful as the exhilarating smiles of approbation which
the school-boy receives from an affectionate parent? Tom would not
have exchanged his feelings for all the world, and he internally vowed
that he would never deviate from a course that had been productive of
so much happiness.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='3' id='Page_3'></span>“But come,” exclaimed Mr. Seymour, “let us all retire into the
library. I am sure that our dear fellow will be glad of some
refreshment after his journey.”</p>

<p class='c016'>We shall here leave the family circle to the undisturbed enjoyment of
their domestic banquet, and invite the reader to accompany us in a
stroll about the grounds of this beautiful and secluded retreat.</p>

<p class='c016'>We are amongst those who believe that the habits and character of a
family may be as easily discovered from the rural taste displayed in
the grounds which surround their habitation, as by any examination of
the prominences on their heads, or of the lineaments in their faces.
How vividly is the decline of an ancient race depicted by the chilling
desolation which reigns around the mansion, and by the rank weed which
insolently triumphs over its fading splendour; and how equally
expressive of the peaceful and contented industry of the thriving
cottager, is the well cultivated patch which adjoins the humble
dwelling, around whose rustic porch the luxuriant lilac clusters, or
the aspiring woodbine twines its green tendrils and sweetly-scented
blossoms! In like manner did the elegantly disposed grounds of Overton
Lodge at once announce the classic taste and fostering presence of a
refined and highly cultivated family.</p>

<p class='c016'>The house, which was in the Ionic style of architecture, was situated
on the declivity of a hill, so that the verdant lawn which was spread
before its southern front, after retaining its level for a short
distance, gently sloped to the vale beneath, and was terminated by a
luxuriant shrubbery, over which the eye commanded a range of fair
enclosure, beautified by an irregularly undulating surface, and
interspersed with rich masses of wood. The uniformity of the lawn was
broken by occasional clumps of flowering shrubs, so artfully selected
and arranged, as to afford all the varied charms of contrast; while,
here and there, a lofty elm flung its gigantic arms over the sward
beneath,
<span class='pageno' title='4' id='Page_4'></span>and cast a deep shade, which enabled the inhabitants of the Lodge to enjoy
the air, even during the heat of a meridian sun. The shrubbery, which
occupied a considerable portion of the valley, stretched for some
distance up the western part of the hill; and, could Shenstone have
wandered through its winding paths and deep recesses, his favourite
Leasowes might have suffered from a comparison. Here were mingled
shrubs of every varied dye; the elegant foliage of white and scarlet
acacias was blended with the dark-green-leaved chestnut; and the
stately branches of the oak were relieved by the gracefully pendulous
boughs of the beech. At irregular intervals, the paths expanded into
verdant glades, in each of which the bust of some departed poet or
philosopher announced the genius to which they were severally
consecrated. From a description of one or two of these sequestered
spots, the reader will readily conceive the taste displayed in those
upon which our limits will not allow us to dwell.</p>

<p class='c016'>After winding, for some distance, through a path so closely
interwoven with shrubs and trees, that scarcely a sunbeam could
struggle through the foliage, a gleam of light burst through the
gloom, and displayed a beautiful marble figure, which had been
executed by a Roman artist, representing Flora in the act of being
attired by Spring. It was placed in the centre of the expanse formed
by the retiring trees, and at its base were flowering, at measured
intervals, a variety of those plants to which Linnæus has given the
name of <i>Equinoctial flowers</i>, since they open and close at certain
and exact hours of the day, and thus by proper arrangement constitute
the <span class='sc'>Horologe of Flora</span>,<a href='#note1'>(1)</a><a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c017'><sup>[2]</sup></a> or Nature’s time-piece. It had been
constructed, under the direction of her mother, by Louisa Seymour. The
hour of the day at which each plant opened, was represented by an
appropriate figure of nicely trimmed
<span class='pageno' title='5' id='Page_5'></span>box; and these, being arranged in a circle, not only fulfilled the duty,
but exhibited the appearance of a dial.</p>

<hr class='c018' />
<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c016'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. These figures refer to the additional notes at the end of
the work.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c025'>From this retreat several winding paths threaded their mazy way
through the deep recesses of the wood; and the wanderer, quitting for
a while the blaze of day, was refreshed by the subdued light which
everywhere pervaded the avenue, except where the hand of taste had,
here and there, turned aside the boughs, and opened a vista to bring
the village spire into view, or to gladden the sight by a rich
prospect of the distant landscape. After having descended for some
way, the path, losing its inclined direction, proceeded on a level,
and thus announced to the stranger his arrival at the bottom of the
valley. What a rich display of woodland scenery was suddenly presented
to his view! A rocky glen, in which large masses of sandstone were
grouped with picturesque boldness, terminated the path, and formed an
area wherein he might gaze on the mighty sylvan amphitheatre, which
gradually rose to a towering height above him, and seemed to interpose
an insuperable barrier between the solitude of this sequestered spot
and the busy haunts of men; not a sound assailed the ear, save the
murmur of the summer breeze, as it swept the trembling foliage, or the
brawling of a small mountain stream, which gushed from the rock, and,
like an angry chit, fretted and fumed as it encountered the obstacles
that had been raised by its own impetuosity. This was the favourite
retreat of Mr. Seymour, and he had dedicated it to the genius of
geology; here had he erected a temple to the memory of Werner, and
every pillar and ornament bore testimony to the refined taste of its
architect. It consisted of a dome, constructed of innumerable shells
and corallines, and surmounted by a marble figure of Atlas, bearing
the globe on his shoulders, upon which the name of <span class='sc'>Werner</span> was
inscribed. The dome was supported by twelve pillars
<span class='pageno' title='6' id='Page_6'></span>of so singular and beautiful a construction as to merit a particular
description: the Corinthian capital of each was of Pentelican marble;
the column consisted of a spiral of about six inches in breadth, which
wound round a central shaft of not more than two inches in diameter;
upon this spiral were placed specimens of various rocks, of such
masses as to fill up the outline, and to present to the eye the
appearance of a substantial and well-proportioned pillar. These
specimens were arranged in an order corresponding with their
acknowledged geological relations; thus, the <i>Diluvial</i> productions
occupied the higher compartments; the <i>Primitive</i> strata, the lower
ones; and the <i>Secondary</i> and <i>Transition</i> series found an
intermediate place. The tessellated floor presented the different
varieties of marble, so artfully interspersed as to afford a most
harmonious combination; the <i>Unicoloured, variegated, Madreporic</i>, the
<i>Lumachella, Cipolino</i>, and <i>Breccia</i> marbles, were each represented
by a characteristic and well-defined specimen. The alcoved ceiling was
studded with <i>Rock Crystal</i>, calcareous <i>Stalactites</i>, and beautiful
<i>Calcedonies</i>. A group of figures in <i>basso relievo</i> adorned the wall
which enclosed about a third part of the interior of the temple, and
its subject gave evidence of the Wernerian devotion of Mr. Seymour;
for it represented a contest between Pluto and Neptune, in which the
watery god was seen in the act of wresting the burning torch from the
hand of his adversary, in order to quench it in the ocean. Mr. Seymour
had studied in the school of Freyburg, under the auspices of its
celebrated professor; and, like all the pupils of Werner, he
pertinaciously maintained the aqueous origin of our strata. But let us
return to the happy party at the Lodge, whom the reader will remember
we left at their repast. This having been concluded, and all those
various subjects discussed, and questions answered, which the
school-boy, who has ever felt the
<span class='pageno' title='7' id='Page_7'></span>satisfaction of returning home for the holidays, will more easily
conceive than we can describe, Tom enquired of his father, whether his
old friend, Mr. Twaddleton, the Vicar of Overton, was well, and at the
Parsonage. “He is quite well,” replied Mr. Seymour, “and so anxious to
see you, that he has paid several visits, during the morning, to
enquire whether you had arrived. Depend upon it, that many hours will
not elapse before you see him.”</p>

<p class='c016'>In that wish did Tom and the whole juvenile party heartily concur; for
the vicar, notwithstanding his oddities, was the most affectionate
creature in existence, and never was he more truly happy than when
contributing to the innocent amusement of his little “<i>playmates</i>,”
as he used to call Tom and his sisters.</p>

<p class='c016'>It may be here necessary to present the reader with a short sketch of
the character of a person, who will be hereafter found to perform a
prominent part in the little drama of Overton Lodge.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Rev. Peter Twaddleton, Master of Arts, and Fellow of the
Society of Antiquaries, for we must introduce him in due form, was
about fifty-two years of age, twenty of which he had spent at
Cambridge, as a resident Fellow of Jesus College. He had not possessed
the vicarage of Overton above eight or nine years; and, although its
value never exceeded a hundred and eighty pounds a year, so limited
were his wants, and so frugal his habits, that he generally contrived
to save a considerable sum out of his income, in order that he might
devote it to purposes of charity and benevolence: his charity,
however, was not merely of the hand, but of the heart; distress was
unknown in his village; he fed the hungry, nursed the sick, and
cheered the unfortunate; his long collegiate residence had imparted to
his mind several peculiar traits, and a certain stiffness of address
and quaintness of manner which at once distinguish the
<span class='pageno' title='8' id='Page_8'></span>recluse from the man of the world; in short, as Shakspeare expresses it, “<i>he
was not hackneyed in the ways of men</i>.” His face was certainly the
very reverse to everything that could be considered “good-looking,”
and yet, when he smiled, there was an animation that redeemed the
irregularity of his angular features; so benevolent was the expression
of his countenance, that it was impossible not to feel that sentiment
of respect and admiration which the presence of a superior person is
wont to inspire; but his superiority was rather that of the heart than
of the head; not that we would insinuate any deficiency in intellect,
but that his moral excellencies were so transcendent as to throw into
the shade all those mental qualities which he possessed in common with
the world. He entertained a singular aversion to the mathematics, a
prejudice which we are inclined to refer to his disappointment in the
senate-house; for, although he was known at Cambridge as one of those
“pale beings in spectacles and cotton stockings,” commonly called
“<i>reading men</i>,” yet, after all his exertions, he only succeeded in
obtaining the “<i>wooden spoon</i>,” an honour which devolves upon the last
of the “<i>junior optimes</i>.” Whether his failure arose from an exuberant
or a deficient genius, or, to speak <i>phrenologically</i>, from an excess
in his <i>number of bumps</i>, or a defect in his <i>bump of numbers</i>, we are
really unable to state, never having had an opportunity of verifying
our suspicions by a manual examination of his cranium; he was,
however, well read in the classics, and so devoted to the works of
Virgil that he never lost an opportunity of quoting his favourite
poet; and it must be admitted, that, although these quotations so
generally pervaded his conversation as to become irksome, they were
sometimes apposite, and now and then even witty. But notwithstanding
the delight which he experienced in a <i>lusus verborum</i> in a learned
language, of such contradictory materials was he
<span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'></span>compossed, that his antipathy to an English pun was extravagant and ridiculous.
This peculiarity has been attributed, but we speak merely from common
report, to a disgust which he contracted for that species of spurious
wit, during his frequent intercourse with the Johnians, a race of
students who have, from time immemorial, been identified with the most
profligate class of punsters; be this, however, as it may, we are
inclined to believe that a person who resides much amongst those who
are addicted to this <i>vice</i>, unless he quickly takes the infection,
acquires a sort of constitutional insusceptibility, like nurses, who
pass their lives in infected apartments with perfect safety and
impunity. His favourite, and we might add his only pursuit, beyond the
circle of his profession, was the study of antiquities; he was, as we
have already stated, a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries; had
collected a very tolerable series of ancient coins, and possessed
sufficient critical acumen to distinguish between Attic <i>ærugo</i>, and
the spurious <i>verdure</i> of the modern counterfeit. Often had he
undertaken an expedition of a hundred miles to inspect the interior of
an ancient barrow, or to examine the mouldering fragments of some
newly-discovered monument; indeed, like the connoisseur in cheese,
blue-mould and decay were the favourite objects of his taste, and the
sure passports to his favour; for he despised all <i>living</i> testimony,
but that of worms and maggots. A coin with the head of a <i>living</i>
sovereign passed through his hands with as little resistance as water
through a sieve, but he grasped the head of an Antonine or Otho with
insatiable and relentless avarice. Mr. Twaddleton’s figure exceeded
the middle stature, and was so extremely slender as to give him the
air and appearance of a tall man. He was usually dressed in an
old-fashioned suit of black cloth, consisting of a single-breasted
coat, with a standing collar, and deep comprehensive cuffs, and a
flapped waistcoat; but
<span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span>so awkwardly did these vestments conform with the contour of his person,
that we might have supposed them the production of those Laputan
tailors who wrought by mathematical principles, and held in sovereign
contempt the illiterate fashioners who deemed it necessary to measure
the forms of their customers; although it was whispered by certain
censorious spinsters in the village that the aforesaid mathematical
artists were better acquainted with the <i>angles</i> of the Seven Dials,
than with the <i>squares</i> of the west end. They farther surmised that
the vicar’s annual journey to London, which in truth was undertaken
with no other objects than those of attending the anniversary of the
Society of Antiquaries, on Saint George’s day, and of inspecting the
cabinets of his old crony, the celebrated medallist of
Tavistock-street, was for the laudable purpose of recruiting his
wardrobe. If the aforesaid coat, with its straggling and
disproportioned suburbs, possessed an amplitude of dimensions which
ill accorded with the slender wants of his person, this misapplied
liberality was more than compensated by the rigid economy exhibited in
the <i>nether</i> part of his costume, which evidently had not been
designed by a contemporary artisan; not so his shoes, which, for the
accommodation of those unwelcome parasites, vulgarly called <i>corns</i>,
were constructed in the form of a battledore, and displayed such an
unbecoming quantity of leather, that, as Ned Hopkins, a subaltern wit
of the village alehouse, observed, “however economical their parson
might appear, he was undoubtedly <i>supported in extravagance</i>.” Nor did
the natural association between tithes and “<i>corn-bags</i>” escape his
observation, but was repeated with various other allusions of equal
piquancy, to the no small annoyance of the reverend gentleman, and, as
he declared, to the disparagement of his cloth.</p>

<p class='c016'>After the social repast had been concluded, Tom proposed a ramble
through the shrubbery. He was
<span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span>anxious to revisit the scene of his former sports; and Louisa readily met his
wishes, for she was also desirous of showing him the <i>botanical
clock</i>, which had been planned and completed since his absence. Mr.
Seymour accompanied his children, and, as they walked across the lawn,
Tom asked his father whether he remembered the promise he had made him
on quitting home for school, that of furnishing him with some new
amusements during the holidays.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I perfectly remember,” said his father, “the promise to which you
allude, and I hope that you equally well recollect the conditions with
which it was coupled. When your mamma gave you a copy of Mrs. Marcet’s
instructive Dialogues on Natural Philosophy, I told you that, after
you had studied the principles which that work so admirably explains,
you would have but little difficulty in understanding the philosophy
of toys, or the manner in which each produced its amusing effects; and
that, when the midsummer holidays commenced, I would successively
supply you with a new amusement, whenever you could satisfactorily
explain the principles of those you already possessed. Was not that
our contract?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It was,” exclaimed Tom, with great eagerness, “and I am sure I shall
win the prize, whenever you will try me, and I hope my mamma and
sisters will be present.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Certainly,” replied Mr. Seymour, “and I trust that Louisa and Fanny,
who are of an age to understand the subject, will not prove
uninterested spectators. John, too, will profit by our scheme; for, as
I shall necessarily require, for illustration, certain toys which can
scarcely afford any amusement to a boy of your age and acquirements,
it is but fair that they should be transferred into his hands; our
little philosopher, Matthew, will also, I am sure, enter into the
spirit of our pastimes with the greatest satisfaction.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span>“Thank you! thank you! dear papa,” was simultaneously shouted by
several voices, and the happy children looked forward to the morrow
with that mixed sensation of impatience and delight which always
attends juvenile anticipations.</p>

<p class='c016'>On the following morning, the vicar was seen approaching, and Tom and
his sisters immediately ran forward to greet him.</p>

<p class='c016'>“My dear boy,” exclaimed the vicar, “I am truly rejoiced to see
you;--when did you arrive from school?--How goes on Virgil?--Hey, my
boy?--You must be delighted with the great Mantuan bard;--now confess,
you little Trojan, can you eat a cheesecake without being reminded of
the Harpy’s prophecy, and its fulfilment, as discovered by young
Ascanius:--</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c026'>
    <div><b>Heus! etiam <i>mensas</i> consumimus, inquit Iulus.</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='c027'><b><span class='sc'>Æn.</span> vii. 116.        </b></div>

<p class='c025'>“But, bless me, how amazingly you have grown! and how healthy you
look!” Tom took advantage of this pause in the vicar’s address, which
had hitherto flowed in so uninterrupted and rapid a stream as to
preclude the possibility of any reply to his questions, to inform him
that his father was on the lawn, and desirous of seeing him.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Mr. Twaddleton,” exclaimed Mr. Seymour, “you are just in time to
witness the commencement of a series of amusements, which I have
proposed for Tom’s instruction during the holidays.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Amusement and instruction,” replied the vicar, “are not synonymous in
my vocabulary; unless, indeed, they be applied to the glorious works
of Virgil; but let me hear your scheme.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I have long thought,” said Mr. Seymour, “that all the first
principles of natural philosophy might be easily taught, and
beautifully illustrated, by the common
<span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'></span>toys which have been invented for the amusement of youth.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“A fig for your philosophy,” was the unceremonious and chilling reply
of the vicar. “What have boys,” continued he, “to do with philosophy?
Let them learn their grammar, scan their hexameters, and construe
Virgil; it is time enough to inflict upon them the torments of science
after their names have been entered on the University boards.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I differ from you entirely, my worthy friend; the principles of
natural philosophy cannot be too early inculcated, nor can they be too
widely diffused. It is surely a great object to engage the
prepossessions on the side of truth, and to direct the natural
curiosity of youth to useful objects.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Hoity toity!” exclaimed the reverend gentleman, “such principles
accord not with my creed; heresy, downright heresy; that a man of your
excellent sense and intelligence can be so far deceived! But the world
has run mad; and much do I grieve to find, that the seclusion of
Overton Lodge has not secured its inmates from the infection. I came
here, Mr. Seymour, to receive your sympathy, and to profit by your
counsel, but, alas! alas! I have fallen into the camp of the enemy.
‘<i>Medios delapsus in hostes</i>,’ as Virgil has it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You astonish me--what can have happened?” asked Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“There is Tom Plank, the carpenter,” said the vicar, “soliciting
subscriptions for the establishment of a philosophical society. I
understand that this mania--for by what other, or more charitable term
can I express such conduct?--has seized this deluded man since his
return from London, where he has been informed that all the ‘hewers of
wood and drawers of water’ are about to associate themselves into
societies for the promotion of science. Preposterous idea! as if a
block of wood could not be split without a knowledge
<span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span>of the doctrine of percussion, nor a pail of water drawn from the well
without an acquaintance with hydrostatics; but, as I am a Christian
priest, I solemnly declare, that I grieve only for my flock, and raise
my feeble voice for no other purpose than that of scaring the wolf
from the fold: to be angry, as Pope says, would be to revenge the
faults of others upon ourselves; but I am not angry, Mr. Seymour, I am
vexed, sorely vexed.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Take it not thus to heart, my dear vicar,” replied his consoling
friend; “‘<i>Solve metus</i>,’ as your poet has it. Science, I admit, is
both the Pallas and Pandora of mankind; its abuse may certainly prove
mischievous, but its sober and well-timed application cannot fail to
increase the happiness of every class of mankind, as well as to
advance and improve every branch of the mechanical arts; so thoroughly
am I satisfied upon this point, that I shall subscribe to the proposed
society with infinite satisfaction.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Mr. Seymour! Mr. Seymour! you know not what you do. Would you scatter
the seeds of insubordination? manure the weeds of infidelity?
fabricate a battering-ram to demolish our holy church? Such, indeed,
must be the effect of your Utopian scheme, for truly may I exclaim
with the immortal Maro--</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c026'>
    <div><b>In nostros fabricata est machina muros.</b>”<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c017'><sup>[3]</sup></a></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c025'>“Come, come, my good friend, all this is declamation without
argument.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Without argument! Many are the sad instances which I could adduce in
proof of the evil effects which have already accrued from this
abominable system. I am not in the habit, Sir, of dealing in empty
assertion; already has the aforesaid Tom Plank ventured to question
the classical knowledge of his spiritual pastor,
<span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span>and, as I understand, has openly avowed himself, at the sixpenny club, as
my rival in antiquarian pursuits.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And why should he not?” said the mischievous Mr. Seymour; “I warrant
you he already possesses many an <i>old saw</i>; ay, and of a very great
age, too, if we may judge from the <i>loss of its teeth</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>During this remonstrance, Mr. Twaddleton had been occupied in whirling
round his steel watch-chain with inconceivable rapidity, and, after a
short pause, he burst out into the following exclamation:--</p>

<p class='c016'>“Worthy Sir! if you persist in asserting, that a man whose occupation
is to <i>plane deal</i>, is prepared to dive into the sacred mysteries of
antiquity, I shall next expect to hear that”--</p>

<p class='c016'>“A truce, a truce,” cried Mr. Seymour, interrupting the vicar, “to all
such hackneyed objections; and let us <i>deal plainly</i> with your <i>planer
of deals</i>: you assert that the carpenter cannot speak grammatically,
and yet he gains his livelihood by <i>mending stiles</i>; you complain of
his presumption in argument, would it not be a desertion of his <i>post</i>
to decline <i>railing</i>? and then, again, with respect to his antiquarian
pretensions, compare them with your own; <i>you</i> rescue <i>saws from the
dust</i>, <i>he</i> obtains <i>dust</i> from his saws.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“What madness has seized my unfortunate friend?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c026'>
    <div><b>Infelix! quæ tanta animum dementia cepit?</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c028'>as Virgil has it:--But let it pass, let it pass, Mr. Seymour; my
profession has taught me to bear with humility and patience the
contempt and revilings of my brethren; I forgive Tom Plank for his
presumption, as in that case I alone am the sufferer; but I say to
you, that envy, trouble, discontent, strife, and poverty, will be the
fruits of the seeds you would scatter. I verily believe, that unless
this ‘march of intellect,’ as it has been termed, is speedily checked,
Overton, in less than twelve months, will become a
<span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span>deserted village; for there is scarcely a tradesman who is not already
distracted by some visionary scheme of scientific improvement, that
leads to the neglect of their occupations, and the dissipation of the
honest earnings which their more prudent fathers had accumulated;
‘<i>Meliora pii docuere parentes</i>,’ as the poet has it. What think you
of Sam Corkington, who proposes to erect an apparatus in the crater of
Mount Vesuvius, in order to supply every city on the continent with
heat and light; or of Billy Spooner, who is about to establish a dairy
at Spitzbergen, that he may furnish all Europe with ice-cream from the
milk of whales! ‘<i>O, viveret Democritus!</i>’”</p>

<p class='c016'>The vicar was about to proceed with his lamentations, but the thread
of his discourse was suddenly snapped asunder, and his ideas thrown
into the wildest confusion, by the explosion of a most audacious pun,
which in mercy to Mr. Seymour, as well as to our readers, we will not
repeat.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Mr. Seymour,” exclaimed the incensed vicar, “we will, if you please,
terminate our discourse; I perceive that you are determined to meet my
remonstrances with ridicule; when I had hoped to bring an argument
incapable of refutation, <i>Tum variæ illudunt pestes</i>, as Virgil has
it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Pray, allow me to ask,” said Mr. Seymour, “whether my puns, or your
quotations, best merit the title of <i>pestes</i>?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“That you should compare the vile practice of punning with the
elegant and refined habit of conveying our ideas by classic symbols,
does indeed surprise and disturb me. Pope has said that words are the
counters by which men represent their thoughts; the plebeian,”
continued the vicar, “selects base metal for their construction, while
the scholar forms them of gold and gems, dug from the richest mines of
antiquity. But to what vile purpose does the punster prostitute such
counters? Not
<span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>for the interchange of ideas, but, like the juggler, to deceive and
astonish by acts of legerdemain.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“How fortunate is it that you had not lived in the reign of King
James,” remarked Mr. Seymour; “for that singular monarch, as you may,
perhaps, remember, made very few bishops who had not thus signalised
themselves.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“To poison our ears by quibbles and quirks did well become him who
sought to deceive our senses and blind our reason--the patron of puns
and the believer in witchcraft were suitably united,” replied the
vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well,” said Mr. Seymour, “as this is a subject upon which it is not
likely that we should agree, I will pass to another, where I hope to
be more successful; I trust I shall induce you to view with more
complacency my project of teaching philosophy by the aid of toys and
sports.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Mr. Seymour, the proposal of instructing children in the principles
of natural philosophy, is really too visionary to require calm
discussion; and can be equalled only in absurdity by the method you
propose for carrying it into effect.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Come, come, my dear vicar, pray chain up your prejudices, and let
your kind spirit loose for half an hour: let me beg that you will so
far indulge me,” said Mr. Seymour, “as to listen patiently to the plan
by which it is my intention to turn sport into science, or, in other
words, toys into instruments of philosophical instruction.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And is it then possible,” said the vicar, in a tone of supplication,
“that you can seriously entertain so wild, and, I might even add, so
cruel a scheme? Would you pursue the luckless little urchin from the
schoolroom into the very playground, with your unrelenting tyranny? a
sanctuary which the most rigid pedagogue has hitherto held inviolable.
Is the
<span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span>buoyant spirit so forcibly, though perhaps necessarily, repressed, during the
hours of discipline, to have no interval for its free and uncontrolled
expansion? Your science, methinks, Mr. Seymour, might have taught you
a wiser lesson; for you must well know that the most elastic body will
lose that property by being constantly kept in a state of tension.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“A fine specimen of sophistry, upon my word,” cried Mr. Seymour,
“which would, doubtless, raise every nursery-governess and doating
grandmother in open rebellion against me: but let me add, that it ill
becomes a man of liberal and enlarged ideas, to suffer his opinions to
be the sport of mere words; for, that our present difference is an
affair of words, and of words only, I will undertake to prove, to the
satisfaction of any unprejudiced person. <i>Play</i> and
<i>work</i>--<i>amusement</i> and <i>instruction</i>--<i>toys</i> and <i>tasks</i>--are
invariably but most unjustifiably employed as words of contrast and
opposition; an error which has arisen from the indistinct and very
indefinite ideas which we attach to such words. If the degree of
mental exertion be said to constitute the difference between <i>play</i>
and <i>work</i>, I am quite sure that the definition would be violated in
the first illustration; for let me ask, when do boys exert so much
thought as in carrying into effect their holiday schemes? The
distinction may, perhaps, be made to turn upon the irksome feelings
which might be supposed to attend the drudgery of study, but this can
never happen except from a vicious system of education that excludes
the operations of thought; a school that locks in the body, but locks
out the mind: depend upon it, Mr. Twaddleton, that the human mind,
whether in youth or manhood, is ever gratified by the acquisition of
information; every occupation soon cloys, unless it be seasoned by
this stimulant. Is not the child idle and miserable in a nursery full
of playthings, and to what expedient does he instinctively
<span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>fly to relieve his <i>ennui</i>? Why, he breaks his toys to pieces, as Miss
Edgeworth justly observes, not from the love of mischief, but from the
hatred of idleness, or rather from an innate thirst after knowledge;
and he becomes, as it were, an enterprising adventurer, and opens for
himself a new source of pleasure and amusement, in exploring the
mechanism of their several parts. Think you, then, Mr. Twaddleton,
that any assistance which might be offered the boy, under such
circumstances, would be received by him as a task? Certainly not. The
acquisition of knowledge then, instead of detracting from, must
heighten the amusement of toys; and if I have succeeded in convincing
you of this truth, my object is accomplished.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Thus did Mr. Seymour, like an able general, assail his adversary on
his own ground; he drove him, as it were, into a corner, and by
seizing the only pass through which he could make his escape, forced
him to surrender at discretion.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Why, truly,” replied the vicar, after a short pause, “I am ready to
admit that there is much good sense in your observations; and, if the
scientific instruction upon these occasions be not carried so far as
to puzzle the boy, I am inclined to coincide with you.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Therein lies the whole secret,” said Mr. Seymour: “when an occupation
agreeably interests the understanding, imagination, or passions of
children, it is what is commonly understood by the term <i>play</i> or
<i>sport</i>; whereas that which is not accompanied with such associations,
and yet may be necessary for their future welfare, is, properly
enough, designated as a <i>task</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I like the distinction,” observed the vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Then may I hope that you will indulge me so far as to listen to the
scheme by which it is my intention to turn ‘Sport into Science,’ or,
in other
<span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>words, <i>Toys</i> into instruments of <i>Philosophical Instruction</i>?”</p>

<p class='c016'>The vicar nodded assent.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour proceeded--“In the first place, I would give the boy some
general notions with regard to the properties of matter, such as its
gravitation, vis inertiæ, elasticity, &amp;c. What apparatus can be
required for such a purpose, beyond some of the more simple toys?
Indeed, I will undertake to demonstrate the three grand laws of motion
by a game at ball; while the composition and resolution of forces may
be beautifully exemplified during a game of marbles, especially that
of ‘ring-taw;’ but in order that you may more clearly comprehend the
capability of my plan, allow me to enumerate the various philosophical
principles which are involved in the operation of the several more
popular toys and sports. We will commence with the ball; which will
illustrate the nature and phenomena of <i>elasticity</i>, as it leaps from
the ground;--of <i>rotatory motion</i>, while it runs along its
surface;--of <i>reflected motion</i>, and of the <i>angles of incidence and
reflection</i>, as it rebounds from the wall;--and of <i>projectiles</i>, as
it is whirled through the air; at the same time the cricket-bat may
serve to explain the <i>centre of percussion</i>. A game at marbles may be
made subservient to the same purposes, and will farther assist us in
conveying clear ideas upon the subject of the <i>collision of elastic
and non-elastic bodies</i>, and of their <i>velocities and direction after
impact</i>. The <i>composition and resolution of forces</i> may be explained
at the same time. The nature of <i>elastic springs</i> will require no other
apparatus for its elucidation than Jack in the box, and the numerous
leaping-frogs and cats with which the nursery abounds. The leathern
sucker will exemplify the nature of <i>cohesion</i>, and the effect of water
in filling up those inequalities by which contiguous surfaces are
deprived of their attractive
<span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span>power; it will, at the same time, demonstrate the nature of a <i>vacuum</i>, and
the influence of <i>atmospheric pressure</i>. The squirt will afford a
farther illustration of the same views, and will furnish a practical
proof of the weight of the atmosphere in raising a column of water.
The theory of the pump will necessarily follow. The great elasticity
of air, and the opposite property of water, I shall be able to show by
the amusing exhibition of the ‘<i>Bottle Imps</i>.’”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Bottle Imps!--‘<i>Acheronta movebis</i>,’” muttered the vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour continued--“The various balancing toys will elucidate the
nature of the <i>centre of gravity, point of suspension</i>, and <i>line of
direction</i>: the seesaw, rocking-horse, and the operation of walking on
stilts, will here come in aid of our explanations. The combined
effects of momentum and a change in the centre of gravity of a body
may be beautifully exemplified by the action of the Chinese Tumblers.
The sling will demonstrate the existence and effect of <i>centrifugal
force</i>; the top and tetotum will prove the power of vertiginous motion
to support the axis of a body in an upright position. The trundling of
the hoop will accomplish the same and other objects. The game of
<i>bilboquet</i>, or cup and ball, will show the influence of rotatory
motion in steadying the rectilinear path of a spherical body, whence
the theory of the rifle-gun may be deduced. For conveying some
elementary ideas of the doctrine of <i>oscillation</i>, there is the swing.
The flight of the arrow will not only elucidate the principles of
<i>projectiles</i>, but will explain the force of the air in producing
rotatory motion by its impact on oblique surfaces: the revolution of
the shuttlecock may be shown to depend upon the same resolution of
forces. Then comes the kite, one of the most instructive and amusing
of all the pastimes of youth,--the favourite toy of Newton in
<span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span>his boyish days:<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c017'><sup>[4]</sup></a>--its ascent at once developes the theory of the
composition and resolution of forces, and explains various subordinate
principles, which I shall endeavour to describe when we arrive at the
subject. The <i>see-saw</i> will unfold the general principle upon which
the Mechanical Powers are founded; and the boy may thus be easily led
to the theory of the <i>lever</i>, by being shown how readily he can
balance the heavier weight of a man by riding on the longer arm of the
plank. The theory of colours may be pointed out to him as he blows his
soap-bubbles;<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c017'><sup>[5]</sup></a> an amusement which will, at the same time, convince
him that the air must exert a pressure equally in all directions. For
explaining the theory of sound, there are the whistle, the
humming-top, the whiz-gig, the pop-gun, the bull-roarer, and sundry
other amusements well known in the play-ground; but it is not my
intention, at present, to enumerate <i>all</i> the toys which may be
rendered capable of affording philosophical instruction; I merely wish
to convince you that my plan is not quite so chimerical as you were at
first inclined to believe.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Upon my word,” said the vicar, “no squirrel ever hopped from branch
to branch with more agility,--you are the very counterpart of
Cornelius
<span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span>Scriblerus; but I must confess that your scheme is plausible, very plausible, and
I shall no longer refuse to attend you in the progress of its
execution.</p>

</div>

<p class='c029'>as Virgil has it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour, however, saw very plainly that, although the vicar thus
withdrew his opposition, he was nevertheless very far from embarking
in the cause with enthusiasm, and that, upon the principle already
discussed, he would perform his part rather as a <i>task</i> than a
<i>pastime</i>. Nor was the line which Mr. Twaddleton had quoted from the
Æneid calculated to efface such an impression. It was true, that, like
Anchises, he no longer refused to accompany him in his expedition;
but, if the comparison were to run parallel, it was evident that he
would have to carry him as a dead weight on his shoulders. This
difficulty, however, was speedily surmounted by an expedient, with
which the reader will become acquainted by the recital of what
followed.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I rejoice greatly,” said Mr. Seymour, “that we have at length
succeeded in enlisting you into our service; without your able
assistance, I fear that my instruction would be extremely imperfect;
for you must know, my dear sir, that I am ambitious of making Tom an
antiquary as well as a philosopher, and I look to you for a history of
the several toys which I shall have occasion to introduce.”</p>

<p class='c016'>This propitiatory sentence had its desired effect.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Most cheerfully shall I comply with your wishes,” exclaimed the
delighted vicar; “and I can assure you, sir, that, with regard to
several of the more popular toys and pastimes, there is much very
curious and interesting lore.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour had upon this occasion succeeded in
<span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>opening the heart of the vicar, just as a skilful mechanic would pick a patent
lock; who, instead of forcing it by direct violence, seeks to discover
the secret spring to which all its various movements are subservient.</p>

<p class='c016'>“To-morrow, then,” cried the vicar, in a voice of great exultation,
“we will commence our career, from which I anticipate the highest
satisfaction and advantage; in the mean time,” continued he, “I will
refresh my memory upon certain points touching the antiquities of
these said pastimes, or, as we used to say at college, <i>get up</i> the
subject. I will also press into our service my friend and neighbour
Jeremy Prybabel, whose etymological knowledge will greatly assist us
in tracing the origin of many of the words used in our sports, which
is frequently not very obvious.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour cast an intelligible glance at his wife, who was no less
surprised at the sudden change in the vicar’s sentiments than she was
pleased with the skill and address by which it had been accomplished.</p>

<p class='c024'>It was about two o’clock, when Mr. Twaddleton, in company with Mr. and
Mrs. Seymour, joined the children on the lawn.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Tom,” said his father, “are you prepared to commence the proposed
examination?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Quite ready, papa.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>“Then you must first inform me,” said Mr. Seymour, taking the ball out
of Rosa’s hand, “why this ball falls to the ground, as soon as I
withdraw from it the support of my hand?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Because every <i>heavy</i> body that is not supported, must of course
fall.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And every <i>light</i> one also, my dear; but that is no answer to my
question; you merely assert the fact, without explaining the reason.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Oh! now I understand you; it is owing to the force of gravity; the
earth attracts the ball, and the consequence is, that they both come
in contact;--is not that right?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Certainly; but if the earth attract the ball, it is equally true that
the ball must attract the earth; for you have, doubtless, learnt that
bodies mutually attract each other; tell me, therefore, why the earth
should not rise to meet the ball?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Because the earth is so much larger and heavier than the ball.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is, doubtless, much larger, and since the force of attraction is
in proportion to the mass, or quantity of matter, you cannot be
surprised at not perceiving the earth rise to meet the ball, the
attraction of the latter being so infinitely small, in comparison with
that of the former, as to render its effect wholly nugatory; but with
regard to the earth being heavier than the ball, what will you say
when I tell you that it has no weight at all?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“No weight at all!”</p>

<p class='c016'>Tom begged that his father would explain to him how it could possibly
be that the earth should not possess any weight.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Weight, my dear boy, you will readily understand, can be nothing
more than an effect arising out of the resisted attraction of a body
for the earth: you have just stated, that all bodies have a tendency
to fall, in consequence of the attraction of gravitation;
<span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>but if they be supported, and prevented from approaching the earth, either by
the hand, or any other appropriate means, their tendency will be felt,
and is called <i>weight</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Tom understood this explanation, and observed, that “since attraction
was always in proportion to the quantity of matter, so, of course, a
larger body must be more powerfully attracted, or be <i>heavier</i>, than a
smaller one.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Magnitude, or size, my dear, has nothing whatever to do with quantity
of matter: will not a small piece of lead weigh more than a large
piece of sponge? In the one case, the particles of matter may be
supposed to be packed in a smaller compass; in the other, there must
exist a greater number of pores or interstices.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I understand all you have said,” observed Louisa, “and yet I am
unable to comprehend why the earth cannot be said to have any weight.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Cannot you discover,” answered Mr. Seymour, “that, since the earth
has nothing to attract it, it cannot have any attraction to resist,
and, consequently, according to the ordinary acceptation of the term,
it cannot be correctly said to possess weight? although I confess
that, when viewed in relation to the solar system, a question will
arise upon this subject, since it is attracted by the sun.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The children declared themselves satisfied with this explanation, and
Mr. Seymour proceeded to put another question: “Since,” continued he,
“you now understand the nature of that force by which bodies fall to
the earth, can you tell me the degree of velocity with which they
fall?”</p>

<p class='c016'>Tom asserted that the weight of the body, or its quantity of matter,
and its distance from the surface of the earth, must, in every case,
determine that circumstance; but Mr. Seymour excited his surprise by
saying, that it would not be influenced by either of
<span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span>those conditions; he informed them, for instance, that a cannon-ball, and a
marble, would fall through the same number of feet in a given time,
and that, whether the experiment were tried from the top of a house,
or from the summit of Saint Paul’s, the same result would be obtained.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I am quite sure,” exclaimed Tom, “that, in the <i>Conversations on
Natural Philosophy</i>, it is positively stated, that <i>attraction is
always in proportion to the quantity of matter</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Yes,” observed Louisa, “and it is moreover asserted, that the
<i>attraction diminishes as the distances increase</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour said, that he perceived the error under which his children
laboured, and that he would endeavour to remove it. “You cannot, my
dears,” continued he, “divest your minds of that erroneous but natural
feeling, that a body necessarily falls to the ground without the
exertion of any force: whereas, the greater the quantity of matter,
the greater must be the force exerted to bring it to the earth: for
instance, a substance which weighs a hundred pounds will thus require
just ten times more force than one which only weighs ten pounds; and
hence it must follow, that both will come to the ground at the same
moment; for, although, in the one case, there is ten times more
matter, there is, at the same time, ten times more attraction to
overcome its resistance; for you have already admitted that the force
of attraction is always in proportion to the quantity of matter. Now
let us only for an instant, for the sake merely of argument, suppose
that attraction had been a force acting without any regard to quantity
of matter, is it not evident that, in such a case, the body containing
the largest quantity would be the slowest in falling to the earth?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I understand you, papa,” cried Tom: “if an empty waggon travelled
four miles an hour, and were afterwards so loaded as to have its
weight doubled, it
<span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>could only travel at the rate of two miles in the same period, provided that
in both cases the horses exerted the same strength.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Exactly,” said Mr. Seymour; “and to follow up your illustration, it
is only necessary to state, that Nature, like a considerate master,
always apportions the number of horses to the burthen that is to be
moved, so that her loads, whatever may be their weight, always travel
at the same rate; or, to express the fact in philosophical instead of
figurative language, gravitation, or the force of the earth’s
attraction, always increases as the quantity of matter, and,
consequently, that heavy and light bodies, when dropped together from
the same altitude, must come to the ground at the same instant of
time.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Louisa had listened with great attention to this explanation; and
although she thoroughly understood the argument, yet it appeared to
her at variance with so many facts with which she was acquainted, that
she could not give implicit credence to it.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I think,” papa, said the archly-smiling girl, “I could overturn this
fine argument by a very simple experiment.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Indeed! Miss Sceptic: then pray proceed; and I think we shall find,
that the more strenuously you oppose it, the more powerful it will
become: but let us hear your objections.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I shall only,” replied she, “drop a shilling, and a piece of paper,
from my bed-room window upon the lawn, and request that you will
observe which of them reaches the ground first; if I am not much
mistaken, you will find that the coin will strike the earth before the
paper has performed half its journey.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Tom appeared perplexed, and cast an enquiring look at his father.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Come,” said Mr. Seymour, “I will perform this experiment myself, and
endeavour to satisfy the doubts of our young sceptic; but I must first
take
<span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span>the opportunity to observe, that I am never better pleased than when you
attempt to raise difficulties in my way, and I hope you will always
express them without reserve.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Here, then, is a penny piece; and here,” said Tom, “is a piece of
paper.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Which,” continued Mr. Seymour, “we will cut into a corresponding
shape and size.” This having been accomplished, he held the coin in
one hand, and the paper disc in the other, and dropped them at the
same instant.</p>

<p class='c016'>“There! there!” cried Louisa, with an air of triumph; “the coin
reached the ground long before the paper.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I allow,” said Mr. Seymour, “that there was a distinct interval in
favour of the penny piece;” and he proceeded to explain the cause of
it. He stated that the result was not contrary to the law of
gravitation, since it arose from the interference of a foreign body,
the air, to the resistance of which it was to be attributed; and he
desired them to consider the particles of a falling body as being
under the influence of two opposing forces,--gravity, and the air’s
resistance. Louisa argued, that the air could only act on the surface
of a body, and as this was equal in both cases (the size of the paper
being exactly the same as that of the penny piece), she could not see
why the resistance of the air should not also be equal in both cases.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I admit,” said Mr. Seymour, “that the air can only act upon the
surface of a falling body, and this is the very reason of the paper
meeting with more resistance than the coin; for the latter, from its
greater density, must contain many more particles than the paper, and
upon which the air cannot possibly exert any action; whereas almost
every particle of the paper may be said to be exposed to its
resistance, the fall of the latter must therefore be more retarded
than that of the former body.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span>At this explanation Louisa’s doubts began to clear off, and they were
ultimately dispelled on Mr. Seymour performing a modification of the
above experiment in the following manner. He placed the disc of paper
in close contact with the upper part of the coin, and, in this
position, dropped them from his hand. They both reached the ground at
the same instant.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Are you now satisfied, my dear Louisa?” asked her father. “You
perceive that, by placing the paper in contact with the coin, I
skreened it from the action of the air, and the result is surely
conclusive.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Many thanks to you, dear papa; I am perfectly satisfied, and shall
feel less confident for the future.” Tom was delighted; for, as he
said, he could now understand why John’s paper <i>parachute</i> descended
so deliberately to the ground; he could also explain why feathers, and
other light bodies, floated in the air. “Well then,” said Mr. Seymour,
“having settled this knotty point, let us proceed to the other
question, viz. ‘that a body will fall with the same velocity, during a
given number of feet, from the ball of St. Paul’s as from the top of a
house.’ You maintain, I believe, that, since the attraction of the
earth for a body diminishes as its distance from it increases,<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c017'><sup>[7]</sup></a> a
substance at a great height ought to fall more slowly than one which
is dropped from a less altitude.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Neither Tom nor Louisa could think otherwise. Mr. Seymour told them
that, <i>in theory</i>, they were perfectly correct, but that, since
attraction acted
<span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span>from the centre, and not from the surface of the earth, the difference of
its force could not be discovered at the small elevations to which
they could have access: “for what,” said he, “can a few hundred feet
be in comparison with four thousand miles, which is the distance from
the centre to the surface of our globe?--You must therefore perceive
that, in all ordinary calculations respecting the velocity of falling
bodies, we may safely exclude such a consideration.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“But suppose,” said Tom, “it were possible to make the experiment a
thousand miles above the earth, would not the diminished effect of
gravity be discovered in that case?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Undoubtedly,” replied his father, “indeed it would be sensible at a
much less distance: for instance, if a lump of lead, weighing a
thousand pounds, were carried up only four miles, it would be found to
have lost two pounds of its weight.” <a href='#note2'>(2)</a></p>

<p class='c016'>“This discussion,” observed Mr. Twaddleton, “reminds me of a problem
that was once proposed at Cambridge, to find the elevation to which
the Tower of Babel could have been raised, before the stones would
have entirely lost their gravity.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Its solution,” said Mr. Seymour, “would require a consideration which
Tom could not possibly understand at present, viz. the influence of
the <i>centrifugal force</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I am fully aware of it,” replied the vicar, “and in order to
appreciate that influence, it would, of course, be necessary to take
into account the latitude of the place; but, if my memory serves me, I
think that under the latitude of 30°, which I believe is nearly that
of the plains of Mesopotamia, the height would be somewhere about
twenty-four thousand miles.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour now desired Tom to inform him, since all bodies fall with
the <i>same</i> velocity, what that velocity might be.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span>“Sixteen feet in a second, papa;--I have just remembered that I had a
dispute with a school-fellow upon that subject, and in which, thanks
to Mrs. Marcet, I came off victorious, and won twelve marbles.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Then let me tell you, my fine fellow, that unless your answer
exclusively related to the <i>first</i> second of time, you did not win the
marbles fairly; for, since the force of gravity is continually acting,
so is the velocity of a falling body continually increasing, or it has
what is termed an ‘<i>accelerating velocity</i>;’ it has accordingly been
ascertained by accurate experiments, that a body descending from a
considerable height falls sixteen feet, as you say, in the <i>first</i>
second of time; but <i>three times sixteen</i> in the next; <i>five times
sixteen</i> in the third; and <i>seven times sixteen</i> in the fourth; and so
on, continually increasing according to the odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 9,
11, &amp;c. so that you perceive,” continued Mr. Seymour, “by observing
the number of seconds which a stone requires to descend from any
height, we can discover the altitude, or depth, of the place in
question.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Louisa and Fanny, who had been attentively listening to their father’s
explanation, interchanged a smile of satisfaction, and, pulling Tom
towards them, whispered something which was inaudible to the rest of
the party.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Come, now,” exclaimed Mr. Seymour, “I perceive by your looks that you
have something to ask of me: is Louisa sceptical again?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Oh dear no,” replied Tom; “Louisa merely observed, that we might now
be able to find out the depth of the village well, about which we have
all been very curious; for the gardener has told us that it is the
deepest in the kingdom, and was dug more than a hundred years ago.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour did not believe that it was the
<span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span>deepest in the kingdom, although he knew that its depth was considerable; and
he said that, if Mr. Twaddleton had no objection, they should walk to
it, and make the proposed experiment.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Objection! my dear Mr. Seymour, when do I ever object to afford
pleasure to my little playmates, provided its indulgence be harmless?
Let us proceed at once, and on our return I hope you will favour me
with a visit at the vicarage; I have some antiquities which I am
anxious to exhibit to yourself and Mrs. Seymour.” Tom and Rosa each
took the vicar’s hand, and Mr. and Mrs. Seymour followed with Louisa
and Fanny. The village well was about half a mile distant; the road to
it led through a delightful shady lane, at the top of which stood the
vicarage-house. Mr. and Mrs. Seymour and her daughters had lingered in
their way to collect botanical specimens; and when they had come up to
Tom and the vicar, they found them seated on the trunk of a
newly-felled oak, in deep discourse.</p>

<p class='c016'>“What interests you, Tom?” said Mr. Seymour, who perceived, by the
enquiring and animated countenance of the boy, that his attention had
been excited by some occurrence.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I have been watching the woodman,” said Tom, “and have been surprised
that the sound of his hatchet was not heard until some time after he
had struck the tree.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And has not Mr. Twaddleton explained to you the reason of it?” asked
Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“He has,” replied Tom, “and he tells me that it is owing to sound
travelling so much more slowly than light.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You are quite right; and as we are upon an expedition for the
purpose of measuring depths, it may not be amiss to inform you, that
this fact furnishes another method of calculating distances.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>The party seated themselves upon the oak, and Mr. Seymour
proceeded--“The stroke of the axe is seen at the moment the woodman
makes it, on account of the immense velocity with which light
travels;<a href='#note3'>(3)</a> but the noise of the blow will not reach the ear until
some time has elapsed, the period varying, of course, in proportion to
the distance, because sound moves only at the rate of 1142 feet in a
second, or about 13 miles in a minute; so that you perceive, by
observing the time that elapses between the fall of the hatchet and
the sound produced by it, we can ascertain the distance of the
object.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour fixed his eye attentively on the woodman, and, after a
short pause, declared that he was about half a quarter of a mile
distant.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Why, how could you discover that?” cried Louisa; “you had not any
watch in your hand.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“But,” said Mr. Seymour, “you might have perceived that I placed my
finger on my wrist, and as my pulse beats about 75 strokes in a
minute, I was able to form a tolerable estimate of the interval,
although I confess that it is a very rough experiment, but
sufficiently accurate for the purpose of illustration. In the same
manner we can readily ascertain the distance of a thundercloud, or
that of a vessel at sea firing a cannon. If we do not hear the thunder
till half a minute after we see the lightning, we are to conclude the
cloud to be at the distance of six miles and a half. But let us
proceed to the well.”</p>

<p class='c016'>After a walk of a few minutes, the party reached the place of
destination. On their arrival Mr. Seymour enquired who would count the
time.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Be that office mine,” said Mr. Twaddleton, as he extracted a large
silver time-piece from the dark abyss of his watch-pocket; “and let
Tom,” continued he, “find a pebble.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span>“Here is one,” cried Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Very well: now, then, how will you proceed?” asked Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I shall drop the stone,” replied Tom, “into the well, and observe how
many seconds it will be before it touches the water, and I shall then
set down the number of feet it will fall in each second, and add up
the numbers.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“That,” said Mr. Seymour, “would certainly accomplish your object; but
I can give you a neater, as well as a shorter rule for performing the
sum: you shall, however, first work it in your own way;--but you have
not yet informed me how you propose to ascertain the moment at which
the stone reaches the water.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“By the sound, to be sure, papa; and you will find that a very loud
one will be produced.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“If the depth of the well be considerable, such a plan will not answer
the purpose, since, in that case, there must necessarily be a
perceptible interval between the fall of the stone and the sound
produced by it, as you have just seen exemplified by the woodman,
which, unless taken into account,<a href='#note4'>(4)</a> will vitiate the result.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Tom observed that he had not thought of that difficulty, and did not
know how he could get over it. His father told him, that he must look
at the surface of the water, and mark the moment it was disturbed by
the stone.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Now, Mr. Twaddleton,” exclaimed Mr. Seymour, “are you ready to count
the seconds?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Quite ready.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Then drop the stone.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“One,--two,--three,--four--”</p>

<p class='c016'>“There,” said Tom, “it touched the water.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And there, there,” cried several voices, “what a noise it made!”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'></span>“<i>Facilis descensus Averni</i>,” exclaimed the vicar; “the stone
descended in four seconds.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Now, my boy, make your calculation.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour furnished pencil and paper, and Tom proceeded;--“<i>Sixteen</i>
feet for the first second,--I put that down.”--</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well,” said his father, “and <i>three</i> times <i>sixteen</i> for the second?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“<i>Forty-eight</i>,” cried Tom.--</p>

<p class='c016'>“Put it down.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“<i>Five times sixteen</i>, for the third?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“<i>Eighty.</i>”--</p>

<p class='c016'>“Down with it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And <i>seven times sixteen</i>, for the fourth?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“<i>One hundred and twelve.</i>”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Now, cast up these numbers,” said Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“<i>Two hundred and fifty-six feet</i>,” cried Tom, “is the depth of the
well.”</p>

<p class='c016'>A shout of delight, from the whole juvenile party, announced the
satisfaction which they felt at the success of their first experiment
in <span class='sc'>Natural Philosophy</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'>Louisa observed, that she could not distinguish any interval between
the actual contact of the stone with the water and the sound which it
produced.</p>

<p class='c016'>“At so small a distance as two hundred and fifty-six feet,” said her
father, “the interval could not have exceeded in duration the fourth
part of a second, and was, consequently, imperceptible: we might
therefore, in the present instance, have accepted the sound as a
signal of the stone’s arrival at the water, without prejudice to the
result of the experiment.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour told his son, that the method which he had pursued was
unobjectionable when the experiment did not extend beyond a few
seconds: but that, if a case occurred in which a greater space of time
<span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span>were consumed, he would find his plan tedious: “Now,” continued he, “I will
give you a general rule that will enable you to obtain the answer in a
shorter time without the details of addition. ‘<i>The spaces described
by a falling body increase as the squares of the times increase.</i>’ I
conclude that you already know that the <i>square</i> of a number is the
sum obtained by multiplying the number into itself.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Certainly,” answered Tom; “the square of 4 is 16; that of 3, 9, and
so on.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“This, then, being the case, you have only to square the number of
seconds, and then multiply that product by 16, being the space
described by the falling body in the first second, and you will have
the required answer: apply this rule to the present case; the stone
fell to the bottom in four seconds; square this number, 4×4=16;
multiply this by 16, and we obtain 256.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“That,” said Tom, “is certainly much more simple than my method.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And it has the advantage,” continued Mr. Seymour, “of being more
portable for the memory.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Should any of the villagers observe us,” said Mrs. Seymour, “they
will take us for a party of fortune-tellers.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Of fortune-tellers!” repeated Louisa, with surprise.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Yes, my dear,” replied Mrs. Seymour, “there is a foolish superstition
attached to this, and I believe to many other wells in the
neighbourhood of remote villages, that by dropping pebbles into it,
and observing whether they produce a loud, or only a slight sound, and
noticing the number of times they rebound from the sides before they
reach the bottom, and other absurd distinctions, a person can predict
whether good or evil awaits them.” <a href='#note5'>(5)</a></p>

<p class='c016'>Mrs. Seymour now proposed the party’s return to the Lodge; but Mr.
Twaddleton expressed a hope
<span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span>that they would first favour him with a visit at the vicarage; to which
proposition they readily assented.</p>

<p class='c016'>His antiquated residence, mantled in ivy, and shaded by cypress, stood
on the confines of the church-yard, from which his grounds were merely
separated by a dwarf hedge of sweet-brier and roses; so that the vicar
might be said to reside amidst the graves of his departed
parishioners, and the turf-clad heap evinced the influence of his
fostering care by a grateful return of primroses and violets.</p>

<p class='c016'>Around the house the reverend antiquary had arranged several precious
relics, which were too cumbrous for admission within its walls;
amongst these was an ancient cross, raised upon a platform on four
steps, which from the worn appearance of the stones had evidently been
impressed with the foot of many a wandering pilgrim. These mouldering
monuments of ancient days cast a shade of solemnity around the
dwelling, and announced its inmate as a person of no ordinary stamp.</p>

<p class='c016'>Annette, the vicar’s trusty servant, had watched the approach of the
squire and his family, and, anticipating the honour of a passing
visit, was busily engaged in removing the chequed covers from the
cumbrous oaken chairs, and the various other bibs and tuckers with
which his curiosities were invested, when the party entered the study.
Lucky was it for the vicar’s repose, that the notice had been so
short, or the tidy housewife would, without doubt, have scoured some
of the antique commodities, and destroyed a crop of sacred verdure,
which ages could not have replenished. As matters stood, nothing was
left for poor Annette, but to defend her character at the expense of
her master, who she declared treated her as though she was an old
witch, whenever she was seen with a <i>broom</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Why, papa,” exclaimed Tom, as he cast his eyes
<span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span>around the study, “all these curiosities have been put up since I went to
school.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The boy is right,” said the vicar; “I have only just completed their
arrangement, and I believe,” continued he, addressing himself to Mr.
Seymour, “that there are several rich morsels of antiquity which you
have not yet seen: but I must, in the first place, introduce my young
friends to the wonders of my magic gallery; wherein they may converse
with the spirits of departed emperors, heroes, patriots, sages, and
beauties;--contemplate, at their leisure, the countenances of the
Alexanders, Cæsars, Pompeys, and Trajans;--behold a legion of
allegorical and airy beings, who have here, for the first time,
assumed appropriate and substantial forms:--examine the models of
ancient temples and triumphal arches, which, although coeval with the
edifices they represent, are as perfect as at the first moment of
their construction, while the originals have long since crumbled into
dust. They shall also see volumes of history, condensed into a space
of a few inches, and read the substance of a hundred pages at a single
glance.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“How extraordinary!” said Tom: “why we never read anything more
wonderful in our Fairy Tales.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And what renders it more wonderful,” replied the vicar, “is its being
all true.”</p>

<p class='c016'>So saying, the antiquary took a key of pigmy dimensions from the
pocket of his waistcoat, and proceeded to a cumbrous ebony cabinet
which stood in a deep recess, and displayed an antique structure, and
curiously carved allegorical devices, in strict unison with that air
of mystery with which the vicar had thought proper to invest its
contents. It was supported by gigantic eagles’ claws; its key-hole was
surrounded by hissing snakes; while the head of Cerberus, which
constituted the handle, appeared as if placed to guard the entrance.
The children were upon the tiptoe of expectation and impatience--the
vicar applied
<span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span>the key with the wonder-stirring exclamation of “<span class='fss'>OPEN SESAMA!</span>”--the lock
yielded, and the doors flew open. Disappointment and chagrin were
visibly depicted on the countenances of the brother and sisters.</p>

<p class='c016'>“And so,” exclaimed Tom, “this fine magic gallery turns out to be
nothing more than a box full of rusty halfpence!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I am sure,” said Louisa, “it was quite unnecessary to have engaged
Cerberus as a sentinel over such rubbish.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Hush!” cried the vicar; “you talk like one not initiated in the
mysteries of enchantment: have you not read, that under its spells the
meanest objects have assumed forms of splendour and magnificence?” <a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c017'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c016'>“Like the fabled touch of the Phrygian monarch,” said Mrs. Seymour,
“which we are told transmuted the meanest materials into gold.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“In like manner, then, may treasures of the greatest value appear to
ordinary eyes as mean and worthless.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“This cabinet,” continued Mr. Twaddleton, “is under the influence of a
potent magician; by the touch of her wand, it would become irradiated
as with celestial light, and these rusty coins would be transformed
into all those various objects of interest and delight which I had
promised to show you.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Tom and Louisa looked at the coins, then at the
<span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span>vicar, and afterwards at Mr. Seymour, to whom they cast an enquiring glance.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Then pray,” exclaimed Tom, “wave this mighty wand of your
enchantress, and fulfil your promise.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The enchantress,” replied the vicar, “is not disposed to grant her
favours to those by whom she has not been propitiated.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And what ceremony does she require?” enquired Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The perusal of sundry mystic volumes; and the consumption of a
midnight lamp at her altar,” replied the vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Do you not comprehend the allegory?” said Mr. Seymour. “The enchanted
gallery is no other than a collection of antique medals;--the potent
enchantress, <span class='sc'>Erudition</span>, or that classical learning, without which they
appear of less value than so many rusty halfpence.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You are right,” cried Mr. Twaddleton: “the poetical import of a
device can be alone felt and appreciated by those who are acquainted
with the classical subjects to which it alludes; for, as Addison
forcibly observes, there is often as much thought on the reverse of a
medal as in a canto of Spenser; besides, how frequently do you meet
with hints and suggestions in an ancient poet, that give a complete
illustration to the actions, ornaments, and antiquities which are
found on coins!--In short, the person who examines a collection of
medals, without a competent knowledge of the classics, is like him who
would explore a subterranean cavern without the aid of a torch.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I have already learned one fact,” said Louisa, “with which I was
certainly unacquainted; that the ancients possessed a much greater
variety of money than modern nations.” <a href='#note6'>(6)</a></p>

<p class='c016'>“Of that, my dear,” replied the vicar, “there is some doubt;--the
learned are divided upon the question:
<span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span>some authors maintain that every medal, and even medallion, had its fixed
and regular price in payments, while others, on the contrary, assert
that we are not in the possession of any real money of the ancients,
and that the medals never had any currency as coins. The truth
probably is between these two extremes.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“If these medals were not used as money,” observed Louisa, “for what
purposes could they have been coined?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“To perpetuate the memory of great actions; and, faithful to its
charge of fame, the medal has transmitted events, the history of which
must, otherwise, have long since perished. Nay, more,” exclaimed the
vicar, his voice rising as he became warmed by his subject, “the lamp
of history has been often extinguished, and the medalist has collected
sparks from the ashes of antiquity which have rekindled its flame. You
perceive, therefore,” continued the reverend antiquary, “that such
collections are of the highest importance, and if your papa will allow
you to pass a morning in their examination, I shall easily bring you
to admit, that I have not exaggerated the wonders of my magic gallery.
I will convince you, that it contains a series of original miniature
portraits of the greatest heroes of antiquity; a compendious chart of
history, chronology, and heathen mythology; a system of classic
architecture; and an accurate commentary upon the more celebrated
poems of Greece and Rome. Ay, and I will show you a faithful
resemblance of the very ship that carried Æneas to Italy, and of the
lofty poop from which the luckless Palinurus fell into the ocean.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Twaddleton then favoured Mr. and Mrs. Seymour with a sight of some
of those rarer medals, which he considered as constituting the gems of
his collection.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You do not mean to say,” exclaimed Tom, as he
<span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span>seized a small coin, “that this <i>brass</i> piece is of more value than the large
coin of gold that lies next to it?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Mercy upon us!” cried the vicar, in a tone of agony, “how the boy
handles it!--restore it to its place--gently--gently--that ‘little
brass piece,’ as you call it, is gold, and although it might not have
been worth one guinea fifteen hundred years ago, is now valued at a
hundred. It is a coin of Ptolemy the 8th of Egypt. On the obverse is
the portrait of the king beautifully raised; on the reverse a
cornucopia. I do not believe that the coin was known to Pinkerton when
he wrote his Essay.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“There is, certainly,” said Mr. Seymour, “something very inexplicable
in the tastes and enthusiastic feelings of you patrons of antiquity.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The antiquary,” observed the vicar, “does not regard a cabinet of
medals as a treasure of money, but of knowledge; nor does he fancy any
charms in gold, but in the figures that adorn it; it is not the metal,
but the erudition, that stamps it with value.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Twaddleton now passed on to a different compartment of his
cabinet, observing, that he must exhibit a few of his Roman treasures.
“Behold,” said he, “two gems of unappreciable value; never do I look
upon them but with feelings of the purest delight. Let my young
friends come nearer, and inspect them minutely. This is a large brass
coin of Tiberius, and was current when Christ was upon the earth; next
to it lies a silver <i>Denarius</i> of the same Emperor; its value was
about equal to seven-pence of our money, and was the coin that tempted
Judas to betray his master.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I think,” said Mrs. Seymour, “I have heard you speak of some English
coins of rarity and interest.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“True, Madam, very true, but they are in another cabinet: before I
close the present one, I will, with your permission, give you a
glimpse at my Sulphurs Paduans, and Beckers.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>“Paduans and Beckers!” exclaimed Mr. Seymour, “and pray what may they
be? I never before heard the terms.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“‘My poverty but not my will consents,’ The antiquary who is poor in
purse,” observed the vicar, “must needs be contented with being rich
in counterfeits, or, I ought rather to have said, in possessing copies
instead of originals. Becker was an artist of Frankfort, who excelled
in imitating ancient coins, but he never used his skill for the
purpose of deception, but honestly sold his productions as avowed
copies, which are admitted into the cabinets of the curious under the
name of <i>Beckers</i>. The <i>Paduans</i>,” the vicar added, “derived their
name from two brothers at Padua, celebrated for the accuracy with
which they imitated large Roman coins. Here are the English coins you
alluded to,” said the antiquary to Mrs. Seymour. “This is a shilling
of Henry VII. curious as being the first shilling ever struck; it was
presented to me by a college friend some years ago, and I have been
lately informed that it is so rare as to fetch twenty-five pounds; but
let me beg you to examine attentively this curious little treasure,”
said the vicar, his eyes twinkling with pleasure as he placed the
dainty morsel in the hand of Mrs. Seymour; “it is,” continued he, “a
silver groat of Perkin Warbeck; on one side are the Royal arms, but
without a name; they are surmounted, you perceive, with an arched
crown, and placed between a fleur de lis and a rose.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“What is the inscription?” asked Mrs. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Say <i>legend</i>, Madam, if you please; the words are, ‘<i>Domine, salvum
fac regem</i>,’ the date 1494. The coin is supposed to have been struck
by the order of the Duchess of Burgundy for Perkin Warbeck, when he
set out to invade England.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Pray,” said Tom, “have you got a Queen Anne’s farthing?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is really curious,” observed the vicar, “that
<span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>well-informed persons should still continue to be deceived with regard
to the value of this coin. The absurd notion of its being worth
100<i>l.</i> arose from an advertisement of an old lady, who had lost one,
stating it to be one of the only three known in the world, and worth
at least 100<i>l.</i> The truth is, I understand from my much valued friend
of Tavistock-Street, that these farthings generally fetch from five to
twenty shillings each; there are several different types of them, but
the only one intended for currency is that bearing the date of 1714;
all the others were struck as patterns. This is certainly scarce, in
consequence of the death of the Queen taking place before the coinage
was finished. The farthing and sixpence of Oliver Cromwell are much
more scarce and valuable, the one generally brings 10<i>l.</i> the other as
much as 25<i>l.</i> It appears that, after Oliver had stamped his head upon
them, he was afraid to issue them as current coins, which accounts for
the few which have been handed down to us.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You remind me,” said Mr. Seymour, “of a story I lately heard of a
crown-piece of Oliver selling at a public auction for as much as two
hundred guineas--can it be possible?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You labour under a mistake,” answered the vicar; “the coin you allude
to is known amongst collectors by the name of the Petition crown of
Charles the Second, and it is undoubtedly a most inimitable piece of
workmanship. The story is this: Simon, the artist, had been employed
by Oliver Cromwell, and at the Restoration, in order to obtain the
patronage of Charles, executed the crown-piece in question. It
resembles in its general appearance the common milled five-shilling
piece, but on the edging there are two lines of letters beautifully
executed. The words are ‘<i>Thomas Simon most humbly prays your Majesty
to compare this his tryal piece with the Dutch, and if more truly
drawn and embossed, more gracefully ordered, and more accurately
engraven, to relieve him</i>.’”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span>“And what said Charles to it?” enquired Mrs. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Charles,” said the vicar, “took no notice of him, on account of his
having worked for Cromwell, and the poor artist shortly afterwards
died of a broken heart.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well,” exclaimed Mr. Seymour, “his manes must be surely appeased, if
his crowns now sell for two hundred guineas each.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The party, soon after this exhibition, quitted the vicarage, highly
gratified, and returned to the Lodge, where, after the usual
ceremonies at the toilet, they sat down to dinner; in the enjoyment of
which we will now leave them, and put an end to the present chapter.</p>

<p class='c024'>“The table-cloth is removed,” cried Tom, as he cast a sly glance
through the open window of the dining-room.</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is, my boy,” replied Mr. Twaddleton; “<i>Diffugere nives</i>, as the
poet has it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“<i>Et redeunt jam gramina campis</i>,” added Mr. Seymour, archly, as he
pointed to the green cloth with which the table was covered.</p>

<p class='c016'>“<i>Et decrescentia flumina</i>,” continued the vicar, with a smile; “but,
psha! enough of wine and quotation. Come, let us join the children.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Twaddleton, accompanied by Mr. and Mrs. Seymour, and Louisa, rose
from the table, and proceeded to the lawn.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The gravitation of Tom’s ball,” said Mr. Seymour, “furnished an ample
subject for our morning’s diversion; let us try whether its other
motions will not suggest further objects of enquiry.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I well remember,” observed Louisa, “that Mrs. Marcet extols that
apple, the fall of which attracted the notice of Sir Isaac Newton,
above all the apples that have ever been sung by the poets: and she
declares, that the apple presented to Venus by Paris; the golden
apples by which Atalanta won the race; nay, even the apple which
William Tell shot from the head of his own son, cannot be brought into
comparison with it.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span>“Well said! Mrs. Marcet,” exclaimed Mr. Seymour; “upon my word, had
the mother of mankind used but half such eloquence in praise of an
apple, we cannot wonder at its influence.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“What honours, then,” continued Louisa, “shall we decree to Tom’s
ball, if it instructs us in the first principles of philosophy?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“We are trifling,” observed Mr. Seymour, and so saying, he took the
ball from Tom’s hand, and rolling it along the ground, exclaimed,
“there it goes, performing, as you may perceive, two different kinds
of motion at the same time; it turns round, or revolves on its <i>axis</i>;
and goes straight forward, or, to speak more philosophically, performs
a <i>rectilinear</i> motion.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Tom said that he did not exactly comprehend what was meant by the
<i>axis</i>.<a href='#note7'>(7)</a> His father, therefore, informed him that the axis of a
revolving body was an imaginary line, which was itself at rest, but
about which all its other parts turned, or rotated: “But,” continued
he, “can you tell me whether you understand what is meant by the word
<i>motion</i>?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“If he can,” exclaimed the vicar, “he is a cleverer fellow than the
wisest philosopher of antiquity, who, upon being asked the very same
question, is said to have walked across the room, and to have replied,
‘You see it, but what it is I cannot tell you.’”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Your ancient acquaintances,” observed Mr. Seymour, “entertained some
very strange notions touching this said subject of motion. If I
remember right, Diodorus denied its very existence; but we are told
that he did not himself remain <i>unmoved</i>, when he dislocated his
shoulder, and the surgeon kept him in torture while he endeavoured to
convince him, by his own mode of reasoning, that the bone could not
have moved out of its place: we have, however,
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span>at present, nothing to do with the ancients; the philosophers of our own
times agree in defining motion to be <i>‘the act of a body changing its
situation with regard to any other;’</i> and you will therefore readily
perceive, that this may actually happen to a body while it remains
absolutely at rest.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well, that beats all the paradoxes I ever heard,” cried Tom; “a body
then may be in motion, while it is at rest?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Certainly,” replied Mr. Seymour; “it may be <i>relatively</i> in motion,
while it is <i>absolutely</i> at rest.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“How can a body change its place,” said Louisa, “except by moving?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Very readily,” answered her father; “it may have its relative
situation changed with respect to surrounding objects; there is your
ball, and here is a stone, has not each of them a particular situation
with respect to the other; and by moving one, do I not change the
<i>relative</i> situation of both?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I perceive your meaning,” said Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“To prevent confusion, therefore, in our ideas, it became necessary to
distinguish these two kinds of motion from each other by appropriate
terms; and, accordingly, where there has been an actual change of
place, in the common meaning of the term, the motion which produced it
is termed <b><span class='fss'>ABSOLUTE</span></b> motion; whereas, on the contrary, when the
situation has been only relatively changed, by an alteration in the
position of surrounding bodies, the motion is said to be <b><span class='fss'>RELATIVE</span></b>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Surely, papa,” said Louisa, “no person can ever mistake <i>relative</i>
for <i>absolute</i> motion; what then is the use of such frivolous
distinctions? When a body really moves, we can observe it in the act
of changing its place, and no difficulty can arise about the matter.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Nothing, my dear, is more fallacious than our vision; the earth
appears motionless, and the sun
<span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span>and stars <i>seem</i> as if they revolved round it; but it is scarcely
necessary for me to inform you that our globe is constantly moving
with considerable velocity, while the sun remains at rest.--Mr.
Sadler, the famous aëronaut,” continued Mr. Seymour, “informed me,
that he was never sensible of the motion of the balloon in any of his
excursions, but that, as he ascended into the air, the earth always
appeared as if sinking beneath him, and as he descended, as if rising
to meet him.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Twaddleton here observed, that he had heard a very curious
anecdote, when he was last in London, which fully confirmed the truth
of Mr. Sadler’s statement. “An aëronaut,” said he, “whose name I
cannot at this moment recollect, had recently published a map of his
voyage, and, instead of proceeding in any one line of direction, his
track absolutely appeared in the form of circles, connected with each
other like the links of a chain: this occasioned considerable
astonishment, and, of course, some speculation, until it was at length
discovered, that his apparent journey was to be attributed to the
rotatory motion of the balloon, which the voyager, not feeling, had
never suspected.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And what,” asked Tom, “could have been the reason of his not having
felt the motion?”</p>

<p class='c016'>His father explained to him, that we are only conscious of being in
motion when the conveyance, in which we are placed, suffers some
impediment in its progress. “If,” said he, “you were to close your
eyes, when sailing on calm water, with a steady breeze, you would not
perceive that you were moving: for you could not <i>feel</i> the motion,
and you could only <i>see</i> it by observing the change of place in the
different objects on the shore; and then it would be almost
impossible, without the aid of reason and experience, to believe that
the shore itself was not in motion, and that you were at rest; I
shall, however,
<span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span>be able to explain this subject more clearly by an optical toy which I
have in preparation.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mrs. Seymour here repeated the following passage from that interesting
novel “Anastasius,” which she observed was beautifully descriptive of
the illusive appearance to which their papa had just referred:--</p>

<p class='c016'>“The gradually increasing breeze carried us rapidly out of the Straits
of Chio. The different objects on the
shore,--mountains,--valleys,--villages,--and steeples,--seemed in
swift succession, first advancing to meet us, then halting an instant
alongside our vessel, as if to greet us on our passage, and, lastly,
again gliding off with equal speed; till, launched into the open main,
we saw the whole line of coast gradually dissolve in distant
darkness.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“That is indeed a beautiful and very apposite illustration,” said Mr.
Seymour; “and I think Louisa will now admit, that it is not quite so
easy, as she at first imagined, to distinguish between <i>Absolute</i> and
<i>Relative</i> motion.”</p>

<p class='c016'>As the children now understood what was meant by the term <i>Motion</i>,
their father asked them whether they could tell him what produced it.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I can make a body move by various means,” answered Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“But they may all be reduced to one,” said Mr. Seymour; “viz. some
exertion which is called <i>Force</i>; thus the <i>force</i> of my hand put your
ball in motion; while gravitation was the <i>force</i> which made it fall
to the earth; and I must, moreover, inform you, that a body always
moves in the direction of the force which impels it, and with a
velocity, or rate of motion, which is proportional to its degree, or
strength; and, were there no other forces in action but that which
originally produced the motion, the body would proceed onwards in a
right line, and with a <i>uniform</i> velocity for ever.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“For ever!” exclaimed Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span>“Ay, my dear, <i>for ever</i>: but we will discuss that question presently;
you must first tell me whether you understand what is meant by
<i>uniform</i> velocity.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I suppose that <i>uniform</i> velocity is that which is regular, and of an
equal rate throughout.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Philosophers,” replied her father, “call the motion of a body
<i>uniform</i>, when it passes over equal spaces in equal times.--Now, Tom,
it is your turn to answer a question. Can you describe the meaning of
the terms <i>Accelerated</i> and <i>Retarded</i> motion?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I conclude that motion is said to be <i>accelerated</i> when it moves
every moment quicker and quicker; and to be <i>retarded</i> when it moves
slower and slower.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You are perfectly right; and gravity may either act in occasioning
the one or the other; our experiment at the well this morning afforded
you an example of gravity producing a regularly accelerated motion. I
did not fully explain the fact at the time, because I was desirous of
avoiding too many new ideas at once; we must win our way slowly and
cautiously through the mazes of philosophy: I will, however, now
endeavour to give you as clear an explanation as the subject will
allow.--It is, I think, evident, that if, at the moment you dropped
the stone from your hand, the force of gravity could have been
suspended, it would have descended to the bottom of the well with a
uniform velocity; because there could have been nothing either to
accelerate or retard its motion. But this was not the case, for the
power of gravity was in constant operation; and, if you keep this fact
in mind, you will readily understand how the velocity became
accelerated: for, suppose the impulse given by gravity to the stone,
during the first instant of its descent, be equal to <i>one</i>, the next
instant we shall find that an additional impulse gives the stone an
additional velocity equal to <i>one</i>, so that the accumulated velocity
is now equal to
<span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span>two; the following instant, again, increases the velocity to <i>three</i>, and
so on till the stone reaches the bottom.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Twaddleton observed, the fact might be shortly expressed by
saying, that “the effects of preceding impulses must be added to
subsequent velocities.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour then remarked that the same explanation would apply to
<i>retarded</i> velocity. “If,” said he, “you throw a stone perpendicularly
upwards, the velocity will be as much <i>retarded</i>, as it was in the
other case <i>accelerated</i>, by gravity; the consequence of which is,
that it will be exactly the same length of time ascending that it was
descending.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I should have thought the very reverse,” cried Louisa, “and that it
would have fallen quicker than it rose.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You have forgotten to take into account the force with which the
stone is projected upwards, and which is destroyed by gravity before
it begins to descend.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Certainly,” answered Louisa; “but the force given to a stone in
throwing it upwards, cannot always be equal to the force of gravity in
bringing it down again; for the force of gravity is always the same,
while the force given to the stone is entirely optional. I may throw
it up gently or otherwise, as I please.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“If you throw it gently,” said her father, “it will not rise high, and
gravity will soon bring it down again; if you throw it with violence,
it will rise much higher, and gravity will be longer in bringing it
back again to the ground. Suppose, for instance, that you throw it
with a force that will make it rise only sixteen feet; in that case,
you know, it will fall in one second of time. Now it is proved by
experiment, that an impulse requisite to project a body sixteen feet
upwards, will make it ascend that height in one second of time; here,
then, the times of ascent and descent are equal. But, supposing it be
required to throw a
<span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span>stone twice that height, the force must be proportionally greater. You see,
then, that the impulse of projection, in throwing a body upwards, is
always equal to the action of the force of gravity during its descent;
and that it is the greater or less distance to which the body rises
that makes these two forces balance each other.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Thank you, dear papa, for the pains you have taken in explaining this
subject to us.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Nay,” replied Mr. Seymour, “bestow your thanks upon those to whom
they are more justly due; Mrs. Marcet is entitled to the merit of this
explanation; for I obtained it from her ‘Conversations.’ Before I quit
this subject, I would just observe that, when we come to the
consideration of the bow and arrow, you will, by the application of
the law I have endeavoured to expound, be enabled to ascertain the
height to which your arrow may ascend, with the same facility as you
discovered the depth of the well: for, since the times of ascent and
descent are equal, you have only to determine the number of seconds
which intervene between the instant at which the arrow quits the bow
to that at which it falls to the ground, and halving them, to make the
usual calculation.--But let us proceed to another subject. Roll the
ball hither, Tom; roll the ball hither, I say! you stand as if you
thought it would advance to us of its own accord.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I know a little better than that, too,” cried Tom; “no body can move
without the application of some force.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Nor stop, either,” added Mr. Seymour, “when it is once in motion; for
matter is equally indifferent to both rest and motion.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And yet, papa,” cried Louisa, “unfortunately for your assertion, the
ball stopped just now, and I am sure that no force was used to make it
do so.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And pray, Miss Pert, why are you so sure that no force was opposed to
its progress? I begin to fear
<span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span>that my lesson has been thrown away upon you, or you would not, surely,
have concluded so falsely.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The vicar here interposed, observing that, simple as the question
might appear to those who had studied it, the fact was so contrary to
everything that passed before us, that Mr. Seymour ought not to feel
any surprise at the scepticism of his daughter; he begged to remind
him that the truth, apparent as it doubtless now was, lay hid for ages
before the sagacity of Galileo brought it to light.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour admitted the justice of this remark, and proceeded in his
explanation.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I think,” said he “you will readily allow that matter cannot, in
itself, possess any power of changing its condition: it can,
therefore, no more destroy, than it can originate its own motion; when
it is at rest, it must ever remain so, unless some force be applied
that can impart to it activity; and, when once in motion, it must
continue to move until some counteracting force stops it. To believe
otherwise you must suppose that matter possesses in itself a power to
alter its condition, which is perfectly absurd.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And yet,” said Tom, “when I see my ball or marble stop of its own
accord, how can you blame me for believing it possible?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Your difficulty arises from your ignorance of the existence of
certain forces which act upon the rolling ball or marble. Its
progress, as it rolls along, is impeded and ultimately stopped by the
rubbing, or friction, occasioned by its passage over the ground; and
this will be greater or less, according to the degree of roughness of
the surface; if it be small, the ball will continue for a longer time
in motion; you must have observed, that your marble has always rolled
much farther on a smooth pavement than on a rough gravel walk.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Certainly,” said Tom, “and I well remember, that when we played at
<i>ring-taw</i> last winter on the
<span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span>ice, we were obliged, for this very reason, to extend the usual
boundaries.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Is it not evident, then, that the motion of a body is stopped by some
opposing force; and that, if this could be entirely removed, the body
would continue to move for ever?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“What a provoking thing this friction is,” said Tom, “it is always
interfering with our experiments.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Provoking, is it? I fancy,” said Mr. Seymour, “that you would be much
more provoked by the loss of it: without it, you could not walk, nor
even hold an object in your hands; and yet everything around you would
be in perpetual motion, performing one universal and interminable
dance.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I can readily understand, from what you have said, that, if friction
were removed, motion might continue; but pray how is it that we should
be unable to walk, or to hold anything in our hands?” enquired Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is the friction of the ground which, at every step we take,
prevents the foot from sliding back, and thus enables us to push the
body forwards. Everybody must have felt how difficult it is to walk on
ice, where the friction is only diminished, not entirely removed,”
answered her father; “and as to holding any object,” continued he, “it
is the friction of the body to which we apply our hands that enables
us to hold it firmly.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“To be sure,” exclaimed the vicar; “why, my boy, you must surely
remember, that in ancient combats it was the custom to rub the body
with oil, that the adversary might not be able to keep his grasp.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well,” said Tom, “our houses, I suppose, would remain firm, and we
might sit quietly in our chairs, at all events.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Not so,” replied Mr. Seymour, “for even granting that you had houses
and chairs, which, without the existence of friction would never
exist, the stability
<span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span>of the structures could never be secured; the slightest breath would be
sufficient to make the stones or bricks slide off from each other, and
to reduce your dwellings into dancing ruins.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Tom and Louisa, after some farther discussion, both admitted the
justness of the argument; but, at the same time, would have been
better satisfied if the fact could have been proved by actual
experiment. Mr. Seymour told them that the perpetual revolution of the
earth and heavenly bodies, where no friction whatever existed,
afforded a proof which ought to satisfy them; and, especially, since
it agreed with those views which were proved to be true by an
examination of what took place on the surface of our own globe.</p>

<p class='c016'>We will, therefore, with the permission of our readers, consider this
point as settled, and proceed with the young philosophers to the
investigation of some other topics connected with the doctrine of
motion.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Since a body at rest,” said Mr. Seymour, “can only be set in motion,
or, when in motion, be brought to rest, by the impression of some
force, it must follow, that it can only move in the direction in which
such a force may act; and, moreover, that the degree of motion, or the
<i>velocity</i>, must, other things being equal, be in proportion to the
degree of force used.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Why, truly,” cried the vicar, “my young friends must of necessity
admit that fact; for the body, not having any will of its own, as you
say, must needs, if it move at all, go the road it is driven.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Yes,” added Mr. Seymour, “and it must go with a velocity in
proportion to the force with which it is driven.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Doubtless, doubtless,” cried the vicar, “you admit that also; do you
not, my young friends and playmates?”</p>

<p class='c016'>It is hardly necessary to state, that the children
<span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span>instantly assented to these propositions. The vicar had placed them in so clear
and popular a point of view, as to be intelligible to the lowest
capacities.</p>

<p class='c016'>“With these admissions, then, my dear children,” said their father, “I
shall have but little difficulty in convincing you of the truth of the
other laws by which the direction of moving bodies is governed. At
present, however, it is not my intention to enter upon this subject;
you have some preliminary knowledge to acquire before you can
understand what is termed the <i>Composition and Resolution of Forces</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I shall not easily forget,” said Louisa, “that matter is perfectly
passive, and that it can neither put itself in motion when at rest,
nor stop itself when in motion.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“This indifference to rest or motion,” replied Mr. Seymour, “has been
termed the <i>Vis Inertiæ</i> of matter.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“A very objectionable term,--a very puzzling expression,” exclaimed
the vicar;--“to denote a mere state of passive indifference by the
term <i>Vis</i>, or power, does appear to me, who have been in the habit of
connecting words with ideas, as excessively absurd.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I allow,” said Mr. Seymour, “that the simple word <i>Inertia</i> would
have been more correct; but we are bound to receive an expression
which has been long current. I suppose, however, you know that the
addition of <i>Vis</i> originated with Kepler, who, like my boy Tom, could
not help thinking that the disposition of a body to maintain its
motion, or state of rest, indicated something like power; but we will
not waste our time upon verbal disquisitions. It is clear, that
matter, at rest, resists being put in motion; the degree of that
resistance is always in proportion to the degree of force applied to
put it in motion; or, to speak more philosophically, that
<span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span><i>Action and Reaction are equal, and in opposite directions</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You, surely, do not mean to say,” exclaimed Tom, “that if I strike my
marble, the marble strikes my hand, with the same force in return?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Precisely; that is my meaning.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“What!” cried Louisa, “if a man strikes another on the face with his
hand, do you seriously maintain that both parties suffer the same
pain?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Oh, no, no,” said Tom, “papa can never intend to say that; I am quite
sure, if it were the case, Mr. Pearson would not be so fond of boxing
our ears.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour answered this question, by observing that, if the hand
possessed the same degree of feeling as the face, they would both
suffer equally under the conflict. “If,” continued he, “you strike a
glass bottle with an iron hammer, the blow will be received by the
hammer and the glass; and it is quite immaterial whether the hammer be
moved against the bottle at rest, or the bottle be moved against the
hammer at rest, yet the bottle will be broken, though the hammer be
not injured; because the same blow which is sufficient to shiver the
glass is not sufficient to break or injure a lump of iron. In like
manner, the blow that is sufficient to pain your sensitive face, and
make your ears tingle, will not occasion the least annoyance to the
obtuse hand of your preceptor. The operation of this law,” continued
Mr. Seymour, “will be exemplified in every step of our progress. When
the marble, as it rolls along, strikes any obstacles, it receives, in
return, a corresponding blow, which will be found to influence its
subsequent direction. The peg of the top, as it rubs on the ground, is
as much influenced by the friction, as if a force were actually
applied to it when in a state of rest; and when we consider the forces
by which the kite is made to ascend into the air, you
<span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span>will learn, from the same law, the nature of that advantage which you
derive from running with it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The vicar observed that the subject of <i>Momentum</i> might be introduced,
and advantageously explained, upon this occasion.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Momentum,” said Tom; “and pray what is that?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is a power,” replied his father, “intimately connected with
motion; and, therefore, as your friend, the vicar, justly remarks, may
be very properly introduced before we quit that subject.--It is the
force with which a body in motion strikes against another body.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“That,” observed Tom, “must of course depend upon the velocity of the
body’s motion.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Undoubtedly, my dear; the quicker a body moves, the greater must be
the force with which it would strike against another body; but we also
know that the heavier a body is, the greater also will be its force;
so that <i>momentum</i>, you perceive, must have a relation to both these
circumstances, viz. velocity, and weight; or, to speak more correctly,
<i>the momentum of a body is composed of its quantity of matter,
multiplied by its quantity of motion</i>: for example, if the weight of a
body be represented by the number 3, and its velocity also by 3, its
<i>momentum</i> will be represented by 3 x 3 = 9; so that, in producing
momentum, increased velocity will always compensate for deficiency of
matter, and a light body may thus be made a more effective force than
a heavy one, provided that its velocity be proportionally increased;
thus, a small ball weighing only <i>two pounds</i>, and moving at the rate
of <i>five hundred feet</i> in a second, will produce as much effect as a
cannon ball of <i>ten pounds</i> in weight, provided it moved only at the
rate of <i>one hundred feet</i> in the same time.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Let me see,” cried Tom, “whether I understand
<span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span>your statement. We must multiply, as you say, the weight by the velocity;
the weight of the small ball you state at two pounds, and it travels
at the rate of five hundred feet in a second; then its momentum must
be a thousand. The weight of the great ball is ten pounds, its
velocity only a hundred feet, then its momentum must also be a
thousand; because, in both cases, the sums multiplied into each other
will give the same product.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Exactly: and thus you perceive that the small ball becomes an exact
balance to the larger one; the first making out in motion what it
wanted in matter, while the latter makes out in matter what it wanted
in motion. I wish you to keep this law of <i>Momentum</i> in your
remembrance; upon it depends the action of all the <i>mechanical
powers</i><a href='#note8'>(8)</a>, as they are termed.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I have heard,” said Louisa, “that a feather might be made to produce
as much havoc as a cannon shot, if you could give it sufficient
velocity.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Unquestionably: but there is a practical difficulty in the attempt,
from the resistance of the air, which increases, as you have already
seen in the experiment of the paper and penny-piece (p. 30), as the
weight of a body decreases. Were it not for this resistance of the
air, a hailstone falling from the clouds would acquire such a
momentum, from its accelerated velocity, as to descend like a bullet
from a gun, and destroy every thing before it; even those genial
showers which refresh us in the spring and summer months, would,
without such a provision, destroy the herbage they are so well
calculated to cherish. Had the elephant possessed the mobility of the
beetle, it would have overturned mountains. From this view of the
subject of Momentum,” continued Mr. Seymour, “you will easily
understand why the immense battering rams, used by the ancients, in
the art of war, should have given place
<span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>to cannon balls, of but a few pounds in weight. Suppose, for example,
that the battering ram of Vespasian weighed 100,000 pounds, and was
moved, we will admit, with such a velocity, by strength of hands, as
to pass through 20 feet in one second of time, and that this was found
sufficient to demolish the walls of Jerusalem, can you tell me with
what velocity a 32-pounder must move to do the same execution?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I will try,” said Tom, as he took out his pencil and pocket-book, to
make the calculation. “The momentum of the battering ram must be
estimated by its weight, multiplied into the space passed over in a
second of time; which is 100,000 multiplied by 20; that will give
2,000,000. Now, if this momentum, which must also be that of the
cannon ball, be divided by the weight of the ball, it will give the
velocity required, which I make out to be 62,500 feet.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Admirably calculated,” said Mr. Seymour: “and I will take care, my
dear Tom, that your intelligence shall be suitably rewarded.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Twaddleton here observed, that he thought “his young friends and
playmates” must have received, for that day, as much philosophy as
they could conveniently carry away without fatigue. Mr. Seymour
concurred in this observation; and the more readily, as the path they
had to travel was rugged, and beset with difficulties. “I will,
therefore,” said he, “not impose any farther burthen upon them; but I
will assist them in tying, into separate bundles, the materials which
they have collected in their progress, in order that they may convey
them away with greater ease and security. Know then, my dear
children,” said the affectionate parent, “that you have this day been
instructed in the three great Laws of Motion, viz.</p>

<p class='c032'>I. <i>That every body will continue in a state of rest, until put
into motion by some external force applied
<span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>to it, and if that force be single, the motion so produced will
be rectilinear, i.e. in the direction of a straight line.</i></p>

<p class='c033'>II. <i>Change of motion is always proportional to the moving force
impressed, and is always made in the direction of the right line
in which the force acts.</i></p>

<p class='c034'>III. <i>Action and Reaction are equal in equal quantities of
matter, and act in contrary directions to each other.”</i></p>

<p class='c024'>Just as Mr. Seymour was, on the following morning, stepping upon the
lawn, with the intention of joining his children, Rosa and Fanny both
made their appearance completely drenched with water, and dripping
like mermaids.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Heyday!” exclaimed their father, “how has this misfortune happened?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Do not be angry, papa,” said Tom; “indeed, indeed, it was an
accident. Fanny, observing the water-cart in the garden, had just
begun to wheel it forward, when the water rushed over her like a wave
of the sea, and, upon stopping the cart, it flew over with equal force
on the opposite side, and deluged poor Rosa, who was walking in front
of it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well, well, lose no time in changing your clothes, and meet me again
in half an hour.”</p>

<p class='c016'>At the appointed time the children reassembled on the lawn.</p>

<p class='c016'>“And so then,” said their father, “I perceive that my philosophical
lesson of yesterday has been entirely lost upon you.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The children were unable to comprehend the meaning of this rebuke; but
Mr. Seymour proceeded:--</p>

<p class='c016'>“I trust, however, that the accident of this morning will serve to
impress it more forcibly upon your memory: one example is better than
a hundred precepts.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>Tom was more puzzled than ever.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You have met with an accident; I will endeavour to convert it into a
source of instruction, by showing you how the principles of natural
philosophy may be brought to bear upon the most trivial concerns of
life. You learned yesterday, that a body at rest offers a resistance
to any force that would put it in motion, and that, when in motion, it
equally opposes a state of rest; now let us apply this law for the
explanation of the accident that has just befallen you. The butt was
full of water; when you attempted to wheel it forward, the water
resisted the motion thus communicated to the vessel, and from its <i>vis
inertiæ</i>, or effort to remain at rest, rose up in a direction contrary
to that in which the vessel moved, and consequently poured over; by
this time, however, the mass of fluid had acquired the motion of the
cart, when you suddenly stopped it, and the water in endeavouring to
continue its state of motion, from the same cause that it had just
before resisted it, rose up on the opposite side, and thus deluged
poor Rosa.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Louisa was quite delighted with this simple and satisfactory
application of philosophy, and observed, that she should not herself
mind a thorough soaking, if it were afterwards rewarded by a
scientific discovery.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I will give you, then, another illustration of the same law of
motion,” said Mr. Seymour, “which, instead of explaining an accident,
may, perhaps, have the effect of preventing one. If, while you are
sitting quietly on your horse, the animal starts forward, you will be
in danger of falling off <i>backward</i>; but if, while you are galloping
along, it should stop suddenly, you will inevitably be thrown
<i>forward</i> over the head of the animal.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I clearly perceive,” said Louisa, “that such would be my fate under
the circumstances you state.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Now, then, my dear children, since our friend the
<span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span>vicar cannot attend us at present, suppose we retire to the library,
where I have an interesting experiment to perform, and a new toy ready
for your inspection.”</p>

<p class='c016'>In compliance with their father’s wishes, the children cheerfully
returned to the library, when Mr. Seymour presented Louisa with a
<span class='sc'>Bandilor</span>. Most of our readers are, doubtless, acquainted with this
elegant toy. It consists of two discs of wood, united to each other by
a small axis, upon which a piece of string is affixed. When this
string is wound round the axis, and the bandilor is suffered to run
down from the hand, the end of the string being held by a loop on the
fore finger, its momentum winds up the string again, and thus it will
continue for any length of time to descend from, and ascend to, the
hand. It affords a good example of the operation of <i>vis inertiæ</i>, or
what may, with equal propriety, be termed <i>the momentum of rotatory
motion</i>. Its action may be compared to that of a wheel, which, running
down a hill, acquires sufficient momentum to carry it up another.
There are several toys which owe their operation to the same
principle, of which we may particularize the windmill, whose fliers
are pulled round by a string affixed to the axis of the sails. In
playing with the bandilor, a certain address is required to prevent
the sudden check which the toy would otherwise receive when it arrived
at the end of the string, and which would necessarily so destroy its
momentum as to prevent its winding itself up again. Mr. Seymour now
informed his young pupils that he had an experiment to exhibit, which
would further illustrate, in a very pleasing manner, the truth of the
doctrine of <i>vis inertiæ</i>. He accordingly inverted a wine-glass, and
placed a shilling on its foot; and, having pushed it suddenly along
the table, the coin flew off, towards the operator, or in a direction
opposite to that in which the glass was moving. He then replaced the
shilling, and imparted to the glass a less sudden motion; and, when it
had
<span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span>acquired sufficient velocity, he checked it, and the coin darted
forward, leaving the glass behind it.</p>

<p class='c016'>Louisa, upon witnessing this experiment, observed that she felt
satisfied of the correctness of her father’s statement, when he told
her that, if the horse suddenly started forward, when she was at rest,
she would be thrown off behind, and that if it should suddenly stop on
the gallop, she would be precipitated over its head. The children now
arranged themselves around the table, in order to consider several
curious toys which Mr. Seymour had collected for the purpose of
explaining the nature of the <i>Centre of Gravity</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>“But, in the first place,” said Mr. Seymour, “can you tell me, Tom,
what is meant by <i>The Centre of Gravity</i>?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Its central point,” answered the boy.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Certainly not; the central point is termed its centre of <i>magnitude</i>,
not that of gravity; and it is only when a body is of uniform density,
and regular figure, that these centres of magnitude and gravity
coincide, or fall in the same spot.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I now remember,” cried Tom, “that the centre of gravity is that
point, about which all the parts of a body exactly balance each
other.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Now you are right; it is, in other words, that point in which the
whole weight, or gravitating influence, of a body is, as it were,
condensed or concentrated, and upon which, if the body be freely
suspended, it will rest with security; and consequently, as long as
this centre is supported, the body can never fall; while, in every
other position, it will endeavour to descend to the lowest place at
which it can arrive.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Have all bodies, whatever may be their shape, a centre of gravity?”
asked Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Undoubtedly.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And you say,” continued Louisa, “that every body will fall, if this
point is not supported.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>“Infallibly. And now, Tom,” said Mr. Seymour, “can you tell me what is
meant by the <i>line of direction</i>?”</p>

<p class='c016'>The young philosopher was unable to answer this question, and his
father, therefore, informed him that, if a perpendicular line were
drawn from the centre of gravity of a body to the centre of the earth,
such a line would be termed the <i>line of direction</i>; along which every
body, not supported, endeavours to fall; and he was also informed
that, if this said line fell within the base of a body, such a body
was sure to stand; but never otherwise.</p>

<p class='c016'>Louisa observed that she was not quite sure she understood her papa’s
meaning, and therefore begged for further explanation.</p>

<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/figsiv1011.png' alt='Figures 10 and 11, loaded carts with plumb lines.' class='c035' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>“I will exemplify it then,” replied Mr. Seymour, “by a drawing. <i>Fig.</i>
10 represents a load of stones in a cart moving upon the sloping road
<b><span class='fss'>C D E</span></b>; this load, being low down in the cart, <b><span class='fss'>B</span></b> will represent its
centre of gravity, and <b><span class='fss'>B F</span></b> its line of direction, which, you perceive,
falls much within the supporting or lower wheel <b><span class='fss'>G</span></b>; and there cannot,
therefore, be any danger of such a cart being overturned; but in
<i>fig.</i> 11, the centre of gravity is raised from its former position to
<b><span class='fss'>H</span></b>, and <b><span class='fss'>H I</span></b> is now the line of direction; which, falling without the
base, or wheel <b><span class='fss'>K</span></b>, the load will not be supported, and must
consequently fall. These figures,” added Mr. Seymour, “will also
explain a fact which you must have frequently observed, that a body is
stable or firm in proportion to the breadth of its base; hence the
difficulty of sustaining a tall body, like a walking stick,
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>upon its narrow base; of that of balancing a hoop upon its edge, or a top
upon its point; while, on the contrary, it is almost impossible to
upset the cone or the pyramid, since, in the latter cases, the <i>line
of direction</i> falls within the middle of the base, the centre of
gravity of the body being necessarily low.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I suppose,” observed Louisa, “that this is the reason why carriages,
when too much loaded, are so apt to upset.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Say, when too much loaded on their <i>tops</i>, and you will be right. As
you now, I trust, understand this part of the subject, let us proceed
a step farther: if you take any body, with a view to suspend it, is it
not evident, that if it be suspended by that point in which the centre
of gravity is situated, it must remain at rest in <i>any</i> position
indifferently?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I thought,” said Tom, “we had already settled that question.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“True, my dear boy; but there is another question of great importance
arising out of it, and which you have not yet considered: tell me,
should the body be suspended on any other point, in what position it
can rest?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I do not exactly understand the question.”</p>

<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/figiv12.png' alt='Figure 12 showing kite’s center of gravity.' class='c036' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>“There are,” replied his father, “only two positions in which it could
rest, either where the centre of gravity is exactly <i>above</i>, or
exactly <i>below</i>, the point of suspension; so that, in short, this
point shall be in the <i>line of direction</i>. Where the point of
suspension is <i>below</i> the centre of gravity, it is extremely difficult
to balance or support a tall body by such a method, because the centre
of gravity is always endeavouring to get under the point of support.
Look at this diagram, and you will readily comprehend my meaning. <b><span class='fss'>K</span></b> is
the centre of gravity of the diamond-shaped figure, which may be
supported, or balanced, on a pin passing through
<span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span>it at <b><span class='fss'>M</span></b>, as long as the centre of gravity <b><span class='fss'>K</span></b> is immediately over the point of
suspension <b><span class='fss'>M</span></b>: but if that centre is removed in the slightest degree,
either to the right or left of its place <b><span class='fss'>K</span></b>, the body will no longer
retain its erect position <b><span class='fss'>I K L</span></b>, but it will revolve upon <b><span class='fss'>M</span></b>, and place
itself in the situation indicated by the dotted lines beneath the
point <b><span class='fss'>M</span></b>: and its centre of gravity will now be removed to <b><span class='fss'>N</span></b>, directly
<i>under</i> <b><span class='fss'>M</span></b>, and in the line <b><span class='fss'>K L</span></b>, which, as you well know, is the line
of direction. Have I rendered myself intelligible?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I understand it perfectly,” answered Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“And do you also, my dear Louisa?”</p>

<p class='c016'>Louisa’s answer was equally satisfactory, and Mr. Seymour went on to
state that the information they had now acquired would enable them to
ascertain the situation of the centre of gravity of any plane surface
which was portable, notwithstanding it might possess the utmost
irregularity of shape.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You shall, for example,” continued he, “find the centre of gravity in
your kite.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I cannot say,” observed Tom, “how I should set about it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well, fetch your kite, and I will explain the method.”</p>

<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/figiv13.png' alt='Figure 13, kite viewed right side up.' class='c036' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>Tom soon produced it, and the tail having been removed, Mr. Seymour
proceeded as follows:--</p>

<p class='c016'>“I now,” said he, “suspend the kite by the loop at its bow, and since
it is at rest, we know that the centre of gravity must be exactly
below the point of suspension; if, therefore, we draw a perpendicular
line from that point, which may be easily done by a plumb-line, with a
weight attached to it, such a line will represent the <i>line of
direction</i> (as indicated by <b><span class='fss'>A B</span></b> in <i>fig.</i> 13)”.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span></p>
<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/figiv14.png' alt='Figure 14, kite viewed at a diagonal.' class='c037' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>“It is clear enough,” said Tom, “that the centre of gravity must lie
in the line <b><span class='fss'>A B</span></b>, but how are we to find in what part of it?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“By suspending the kite in another direction,” answered Mr. Seymour,
who then hung it up in the position represented at <i>fig.</i> 14, “and
then by drawing another perpendicular from the new point of
suspension.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The centre of gravity,” said Louisa, “will in that case be in the
line <i>c d</i>, as it was before in that of <i>a b</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“In both the lines!” exclaimed Tom, with some surprise; “it cannot be
in two places.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And therefore,” added Mr. Seymour, “it must be in that point in which
the lines meet and cross each other:” so saying, he marked the spot
<b><i>g</i></b> with his pencil, and then told his little scholars, that he would
soon convince them of the accuracy of the principle. He accordingly
placed the head of his stick upon the pencil mark, and the kite was
found to balance itself with great exactness.</p>

<p class='c016'>“True, papa,” said Tom, “that point must be the centre of gravity, for
all the parts of the kite exactly balance each other about it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is really,” observed Louisa, “a very simple method of finding the
centre of gravity.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is,” said Mr. Seymour; “but you must remember that it will only
apply to a certain description of bodies: when they are not portable,
and will not admit of this kind of examination, their centres of
gravity
<span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>can only be ascertained by experiment or calculation, in which the weight,
density, and situation of the respective materials must be taken into
the account. Having proceeded thus far, you have next to learn that
the centre of gravity is sometimes so situated as not to be <i>within</i>
the body, but actually at some distance from it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Why, papa!” exclaimed Tom, “how can that possibly happen?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You shall hear. The centre of gravity, as you have just said, is that
point about which all the parts of a body balance each other: but it
may so happen that there is a vacant space at this point. Where, for
example, is the centre of gravity of this ring? Must it not be in the
space which the ring encircles?”</p>

<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/figp90.png' alt='One ring supported by a string, and another ring
balanced on a finger.' class='c038' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>“I think it must,” said Tom; “and yet how can it be ever supported
without touching the ring?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“That point cannot be supported,” answered his father, “unless the
ring be so held that the line of direction shall fall within the base
of the support, which will be the case whether you poise the ring on
the tip of your finger, or suspend it by a string, as represented in
the figures which I have copied from the ‘Conversations on Natural
Philosophy.’ I need scarcely add, that it will be more stably
supported in the latter position, because the centre of gravity is
below the point of suspension; whereas in the former the base is
extremely narrow, and it will, consequently, require all the address
of the balancer to prevent the centre of gravity from falling beyond
it. As you are now in possession of all the leading principles upon
which the operations of the centre of gravity depend, I shall put a
few practical questions to you, in order that I may be satisfied you
understand them. Tell me, therefore, why a person who is fearful of
falling, as, for instance,
<span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span>when he leans forward, should invariably put forward one of his feet, as
you did the other day, when you looked into Overton well?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“To increase his base,” answered Tom; “whenever I lean greatly
forward, I should throw the line of direction beyond it, did I not at
the same instant put out one of my feet, so as to extend my base, and
thus to cause the line to continue within it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Rightly answered; and, for the same reason, a porter with a load on
his back leans forward, to prevent his burthen from throwing the line
of direction out of the base behind. So the horse, in drawing a heavy
weight, instinctively leans forward, in order to throw the whole of
his weight as a counterbalance; and yet,” observed Mr. Seymour, “we
are in the habit of ignorantly restraining him by a bearing rein, in
consequence of which he has to call in the aid of his muscles, by
which a very unnecessary exhaustion of strength is produced. Thus is
it that German and French horses draw heavy weights with apparently
greater ease to themselves, because the Germans tie a horse’s nose
<i>downwards</i>, while the French, more wisely, leave them at perfect
liberty. But to proceed. Did you ever observe the manner in which a
woman carries a pail of water?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“To be sure,” said Tom; “she always stretches out one of her arms.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The weight of the pail,” continued Mr. Seymour, “throws the centre of
gravity on one side, and the woman, therefore, stretches out the
opposite arm, in order to bring it back again into its original
situation; did she not do this, she must, like the English draught
horses, exert her muscles as a counteracting force, which would
greatly increase the fatigue of the operation: but a pail hanging on
each arm is carried without difficulty, because they balance each
other, and the centre of gravity remains supported by the feet.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I see,” said Louisa, “that all you have said
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>about the woman and her pail must be true; but how could she have
learned the principle which thus enabled her to keep the centre of
gravity in its proper place?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“By experience. It is very unlikely that she should ever have heard of
such a principle, any more than those people who pack carts and
waggons, and yet make up their loads with such accuracy as always to
keep the line of direction in, or near, the middle of the base. But to
proceed to another example--have I not frequently cautioned you
against jumping up suddenly in a boat? Can you tell me upon what
principle such an operation must be attended with danger?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I suppose,” said Tom, “for the very same reason that a waggon is more
likely to be overturned when its top is too heavily laden; it would
elevate the centre of gravity, and thereby render the line of
direction liable to be thrown beyond the base, and so upset the boat.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour observed, that after this lesson he thought the balancing
which Tom and Louisa had witnessed at Astley’s theatre, last year,
would cease to appear so miraculous. Louisa declared that she had now
discovered the whole mystery.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You have doubtless perceived,” said her father, “that the art
entirely consists in dexterously altering the centre of gravity upon
every new position of the body, so as constantly to preserve the line
of direction within the base. Rope-dancers effect this by means of a
long pole, the ends of which are loaded by weights, and which they
hold across the rope. If you had paid sufficient attention to their
movements, you must have perceived how steadily they fixed their eyes
on some object near the rope, so as to discover the slightest
deviation of their centre of gravity to one or the other of its sides,
which they no sooner detect, than they instantly rectify it by a
countervailing motion
<span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>of their pole, and are thus enabled to preserve the line of direction
within the narrow base. This very same expedient is frequently
practised by ourselves; if we slip or stumble with one foot, we
naturally extend the opposite arm, making the same use of it as the
rope-dancer does of his pole. Many birds, also, by means of their
flexible necks, vary the position of their centre of gravity in the
same manner. When they sleep, they turn it towards the back, and place
it under the wing, in order to lay the greatest weight on the point
above the feet.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“What an interesting subject this is,” cried Louisa, “and how many
curious things it is capable of explaining!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Indeed is it; and I shall take an opportunity of pointing out several
specimens of art <a href='#note9'>(9)</a> which are indebted for their stability to the
scientific application of the principle we have been considering;--but
I have now a paradox for you, Tom.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Let us hear it, papa.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“How comes it that a stick, loaded with a weight at the upper
extremity, can be kept in equilibrio, on the point of the finger, with
much greater ease than when the weight is near the lower extremity,
or, for instance, that a sword can be balanced on the finger much
better when the hilt is uppermost?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“That is indeed strange. I should have thought,” replied Louisa, “that
the higher the weight was placed above the point of support, the more
readily would the line of direction have been thrown beyond the base.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“In that respect you are perfectly right; but the balancer will be
able to restore it more easily in one case than in the other; since,
for reasons which you will presently discover, the greater the circle
which a body describes in falling, the less will be its tendency to
fall. Look at the sketch which I have prepared for the explanation of
this
<span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span>fact, and I think you will readily comprehend the reason of it.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/figp94.png' alt='Man balancing a sword in each hand, hilt up in one, hilt down in other, showing arc of centres of gravity for each.' class='ig006' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>“When the weight is at a considerable distance from the point of
support, its centre of gravity, in deviating either on one side or the
other from a perpendicular direction, describes a larger circle, as at
<b><i>a</i></b>, than when the weight is very near to the centre of rotation or
the point of support, as at <b><i>b</i></b>. But, in a large circle, an arc of any
determinate extent, such as an inch, for example, describes a curve
which deviates much less from the perpendicular than if the circle
were less; as may be seen by comparing the positions of the sword at
<b><i>d</i></b> and <b><i>e</i></b>; and the sword at <b><i>d</i></b> will not have so great a tendency to
deviate farther from the perpendicular, as that at <b><i>e</i></b>; for its
tendency to deviate altogether from the perpendicular is greater,
according as the tangent to that point of the arc, where it happens to
be, approaches more to the vertical position. You see then that it is
less difficult to balance a tall, than a shorter pole; and it is for
the same reason that a person can walk with greater security on high
than on low stilts.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“That is very clear,” said Louisa, “although, before your explanation,
I always associated the idea of difficulty with their height.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I suppose,” added Tom, “that the whole art of walking on stilts may
be explained by the principles you have taught us.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span>“Undoubtedly it may; for the equilibrium is preserved by varying the
position of the body, and thus keeping the centre of gravity within
the base.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It must be a great exertion,” observed Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Before custom has rendered it familiar; after which, there is no more
fatigue in walking on stilts, than in walking on our feet. There is a
district in the south of France, near Bourdeaux, called the Desert of
Landes, which runs along the sea coast between the mouths of the Adour
and Gironde, where all the shepherds are mounted on stilts; on which
they move with perfect freedom, and astonishing rapidity; and so
easily does habit enable them to preserve their balance, that they
run, jump, stoop, and even dance, with ease and security.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“How very odd!” said Tom; “what can be their motive for such a strange
habit?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Its objects,” replied his father, “are important: to keep the feet
out of the water, which, during the winter, is deep on the sands; and
to defend them from the heated sand during the summer; in addition to
which, the sphere of vision over so perfect a flat is materially
increased by the elevation, and the shepherds are thus enabled to see
their flocks at a much greater distance.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c017'><sup>[9]</sup></a> They cannot, however,
stand perfectly still upon their stilts, without the aid of a long
staff, which they always carry in their hands; this guards them
against any accidental trip, and, when they wish to be at rest, forms
a third leg that keeps them steady.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I suppose,” said Louisa; “that the habit of using these stilts is
acquired while they are very young.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is, my dear: and it appears that, the smaller the boy is, the
higher are his stilts; a fact which
<span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span>affords a practical proof of the truth of what I have just stated.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The stork is said, in my work on Natural History, to be always
walking on stilts,” said Louisa; “and yet it does not appear to
fatigue him.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“That is very true,” replied the father; “but you must remember, that
nature has furnished the bird with a provision, by which the legs are
kept extended without any exertion of the muscles, in the manner of
certain springs; a structure which enables it to pass whole days and
nights on one foot, without the slightest fatigue. If you will visit
the cook the next time she trusses a fowl, you will at once perceive
the nature and utility of this structure; upon bending the legs and
thighs up towards the body, you will observe that the claws close of
their own accord; now, this is the position of the limbs in which the
bird rests upon its perch, and in this position it sleeps in safety,
for the claws do their office in keeping hold of the support, not by
any voluntary exertion, but by the weight of the body drawing the
strings tight.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“But, papa,” said Tom, “I have yet some more questions to ask you on
the subject of balancing. I am not at all satisfied about many of the
tricks that we saw last year; indeed, I cannot believe, that many of
those astonishing feats can be explained by the rules you have just
given us.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I very well know to what you allude,” replied Mr. Seymour. “Many
singular deceptions are certainly practised by removing the centre of
gravity from its natural into an artificial situation, or by
disguising its place; thus, a cylinder placed upon an inclined surface
may be made to run <i>up</i>, instead of <i>down</i> hill. I can even appear to
balance a pailful of water on the slender stem of a tobacco-pipe: but
I shall be enabled to explain the nature of these deceptions by some
toys which I have provided for
<span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span>your amusement, and which I must say you are fully entitled to possess, as
a reward for the clear and satisfactory manner in which you have this
day answered my questions. But see! here comes Mr. Twaddleton: he
would really seem to possess an instinct that always brings him to the
Lodge whenever I am preparing some amusement for you.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The vicar smiled as he entered the room, but, unwilling to interrupt
the lesson, he placed his fore finger on his lip, and, with a
significant nod, silently took a seat at the table. The children
laughed aloud at this cautious demeanour; and Tom exclaimed, “Why, Mr.
Twaddleton, our lesson is over, and we are going to receive some new
toys as a reward.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I have here,” said Mr. Seymour, as he opened a large wooden box, “a
collection of figures, which will always raise themselves upright, and
preserve the erect position; or regain it, whenever it may have been
disturbed.”</p>

<p class='c016'>He then arranged these figures in battalion on the table, and striking
them flat by drawing a rod over them, they immediately started up
again, as soon as it was removed. “These figures,” continued he, “were
bought at Paris some years ago, under the title of <i>Prussians</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I declare,” exclaimed the vicar, “they remind me of the rebellious
spirits whom Milton represents as saying that ascent is their natural,
and descent their unnatural, motion.”<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c017'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c016'>“I have seen skreens similarly constructed,” said Mrs. Seymour, “which
always rose up, of themselves, upon the removal of the force that had
pressed them down.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>“I will explain their principle,” said Mr. Seymour.</p>

<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/figp098a.png' alt='Toy soldier mounted on the flat part of a hemisphere.' class='c039' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>“Suppose we first examine the construction of the figure,” observed
the vicar. “Bless me! why it is like Philotus the poet, who was so
thin and light, that lead was fastened to his shoes to prevent his
being blown away.”</p>

<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/figp098b.png' alt='Figure 14. Hemisphere shown in two positions.' class='c040' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>“The figure,” said Mr. Seymour, “is made of the pith of the
elder-tree, which is extremely light, and is affixed to the half of a
leaden bullet; on account, therefore, of the disproportion between the
weight of the figure and that of its base, we may exclude the
consideration of the former, and confine our attention to the latter.
The centre of gravity of the hemispherical base is, of course, in its
axis; and therefore tends to approach the horizontal plane as much as
possible, and this can never be accomplished, until the axis becomes
perpendicular to the horizon. Whenever the curved surface is in any
other position, the centre of gravity is not in the lowest place to
which it can descend, as may be seen by the diagram which I have just
sketched. If the axis <i>a b</i> be removed to <i>c d</i>, it is evident that
the centre of gravity will be raised, and that, if left alone, it
would immediately descend again into its original position.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I understand it perfectly,” said Tom. “When the axis <i>a b</i> is
perpendicular, the centre of gravity will be in its lowest point, or
as near the earth as it can place itself; when, therefore, the figure
is pressed down, the centre of gravity is raised, and, consequently,
on the removal of that pressure, it will descend to its original
position, and thus raise the figure.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span></p>
<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/figp099.png' alt='Toy man mounted on a candlestick with weights jutting out and down from both sides.' class='c040' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>“I see you understand it. Here, then,” continued Mr. Seymour, “is
another toy in further illustration of our subject. It consists of a
small figure, supported on a stand by a ball, which is quite loose;
and yet it is made to turn and balance itself in all directions,
always recovering its erect position, when the force applied to it is
removed. The two weights, in this case, bring the centre of gravity
considerably <i>below</i> the point of suspension or support, and therefore
maintain the figure upright, and make it resume its perpendicular
position, after it has been inclined to either side; for the centre of
gravity cannot place itself as low as possible, without making the
figure stand erect.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“That is very evident,” cried Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I shall next exhibit to you,” continued Mr. Seymour, “a toy that
furnishes a very good solution of a popular paradox in mechanics; viz.
<i>A body having a tendency to fall by its own weight, how to prevent it
from falling, by adding to it a weight on the same side on which it
tends to fall.</i>”</p>

<p class='c016'>“That is indeed a paradox!” exclaimed Louisa. “The next time I see the
gardener sinking under the load of a heavy sack, I shall desire him to
lighten his burden by doubling its weight.”</p>

<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/figp100.png' alt='Toy horse with its back legs on a ledge' class='c041' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>“Will you, indeed, Miss Pert? I do not think so, after you have seen
the operation of the toy I am now about to exhibit. Here, you
perceive, is a horse, the centre of gravity of which would be
somewhere about the middle of its body; it is, therefore, very evident
that, if I were to place its hinder legs on the edge of the table, the
line of <i>direction</i> would fall considerably
<span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span>beyond the base, and the horse must be precipitated to the ground; you
will, however, perceive that there is a stiff wire attached to a
weight which is connected with the body of the horse, and by means of
such an addition, the horse prances with perfect security at the edge
of the precipice: so that the figure which was incapable of supporting
itself is actually prevented from falling, by adding a weight to its
unsupported end!”</p>

<p class='c016'>The children admitted the truth of this statement, and were not
immediately prepared to explain it.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The weight, indeed, appears to be added on that side; but, in
reality, it is on the opposite side,” said the vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>“In order to produce the desired effect,” observed Mr. Seymour, “the
wire must be bent, so as to throw the weight far back, under the
table; by which contrivance, since the centre of gravity of the whole
compound figure is thrown into the leaden weight, the hind legs of the
horse thus become the point of suspension, on which the ball may be
made to vibrate with perfect security.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Now I understand it,” cried Tom; “instead of the weight supporting
the horse, the horse supports the weight.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Exactly so. You perceive, therefore, from these few examples, that
the balancer, by availing himself of such deceptions, and combining
with them a considerable degree of manual dexterity, may perform
feats, which, at first sight, will appear in direct opposition to the
laws of gravity. There is also another expedient of which the balancer
avails himself, to increase
<span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span>the wonder of his performances, and that is the influence of rotatory
motion, which, you will presently see, may be made to counteract the
force of gravity.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I remember that the most surprising of all the tricks I witnessed was
one, in which a sword was suspended on a key, which turned round on
the end of a tobacco-pipe; on the top of the sword a pewter-plate was,
at the same time, made to revolve with great velocity.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I well remember the trick to which you allude. The rotatory motion
prevented the sword from falling, just as you will hereafter find the
spinning of the top will preserve it in an erect position. There is
also another effect produced by rotatory motion, with which it is
essential that you should become acquainted. You, no doubt, remember
that momentum, or the velocity of a body, will compensate for its want
of matter. A number of bodies, therefore, although incapable of
balancing each other when in a state of rest, may be made to do so, by
imparting to them different degrees of motion. I believe that you are
now acquainted with all the principles upon which the art of balancing
depends; and I have little doubt, should we again witness a
performance of this kind, that you will be able to explain the tricks
which formerly appeared to you so miraculous.”</p>

<p class='c024'>Early on Monday morning did the young group assemble in the library;
they had been told by Mrs. Seymour that their father had received a
new toy of a very interesting and instructive nature, and we can
easily imagine the eagerness with which they anticipated the sight of
it.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I trust,” said Mr. Seymour, “that after our late discussion, the
subject of the centre of gravity is thoroughly understood by you all.
I have also reason
<span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>to think that the nature and effects of what is termed <i>momentum</i> have
been rendered intelligible to you.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I certainly understand both those subjects,” answered Tom; and so
thought the rest of the party.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well, then, I will put your knowledge to the test,” observed Mr.
Seymour, “for you shall explain to me the mechanism of these <i>Chinese
Tumblers</i>.” Upon which he produced an oblong box, which, by opening,
formed a series of stairs or steps, and took from a drawer at its end
two grotesque figures (<i>Clown</i> and <i>Pantaloon</i>), which were connected
with each other by two poles, which they appeared in the attitude of
carrying, pretty much in the way that the porters carry the poles of a
sedan-chair. The foremost figure was then placed upon the top step,
when, to the great astonishment of the whole party, the figures very
deliberately descended the several stairs, each turning over the other
in succession.</p>

<p class='c016'>“There was a period in our history,” observed Mrs. Seymour, “when so
marvellous an exhibition would have subjected the inventor to the
penalties of sorcery.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“That,” remarked Mr. Seymour, “may be said of most of the other
inventions which I have yet in store to illustrate the powers
conferred upon us by a knowledge of natural philosophy; but, as far as
mechanical skill is concerned, I doubt whether the ancients did not
even surpass us, especially in the art of constructing automata; and
as quicksilver was known in the remotest ages, I think it not
improbable that it was one of the agents employed by them on such
occasions. If I remember right, Aristotle describes a wooden Venus,
which moved by means of ‘<i>liquid silver</i>;’ then, again, the moving
tripods which Apollonius saw in the Indian temples--the walking
statues at Antium, and in
<span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span>the temple of Hierapolis, and the wooden pigeon of Archytas,<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c017'><sup>[11]</sup></a>
ought, undoubtedly, to be regarded as evidences of their mechanical
resources. But let us reserve these literary questions for the better
judgment of our worthy friend the vicar, and proceed to consider the
mechanism of the toy before us. Tom,” continued he, “take the figures
in your hand and examine them.”</p>

<p class='c016'>No sooner had the young philosopher received the figures from the hand
of his father than he declared that the tubes were hollow, and that he
felt some liquid running backwards and forwards in them.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You are quite right, my boy,” said Mr. Seymour, “they contain
quicksilver.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Now then I understand it,” cried Tom; “the quicksilver runs down the
tubes and alters the centre of gravity of the figures, and so makes
them tumble over each other.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well, I acknowledge that is no bad guess as a beginning, and will
certainly explain the first movement; but you will be pleased to
recollect that the instant a new centre of gravity is thus produced
the figures must remain at rest--how, then, will you explain their
continued motion?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You said something, I think, about momentum; did you not, papa?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Certainly; and to its agency the continuance of the motions is to be
ascribed: but I will explain the operation more fully.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id009'>
<img src='images/figp105.png' alt='Two jokers connected by poles and strings descending some steps.' class='ig009' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour then proceeded to point out the mechanism and movements of
the toy in a manner which we shall endeavour to convey to our readers
by the aid of the annexed engraving.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>“As soon as the figure A is placed upon the step D, in the position A
B, the quicksilver, by running down the inclined tubes, swings the
figure B round to C; and the centre of gravity having been thus
adjusted, the whole would remain at rest but for the contrivance to be
next described. Besides their connexion with the poles by means of
pivots, the figures are connected with each other by silken strings,
which keep the figure B steadily in its position, while it traverses
the arc until it arrives at C, when their increased tension has the
effect of capsizing it, and of thus producing a momentum, which, by
carrying its centre of gravity beyond the line of direction, causes it
to descend upon the step E, when the quicksilver,
<span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span>by again flowing to the lowest part of the tubes, places the figures in
the same position, only one step lower, as they were at the
commencement of their action; and thus, by successive repetitions of
the same changes, it is quite evident that the figures must continue
to descend as long as any steps remain for their reception.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I understand it perfectly,” observed Louisa, with a smile of
satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I need scarcely say,” continued Mr. Seymour, “that there are some
niceties in the adjustment of the minuter parts of the apparatus,
without which the effect could not be accomplished; the quantity of
quicksilver, for instance, must bear its proper proportion to the
weight and dimensions of the figure: and in order to prevent its too
rapid passage along the inclined tubes, strings are stretched across
their interior to retard the stream. Then, again, some management is
necessary with regard to the silken strings, in order to ensure a
necessary degree of tension. I will now show you,” said he, “a single
tumbler, which will perform the same motions without the assistance of
any tubes.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“But not without quicksilver,” observed Tom, “which, I suppose, must,
in this case, be put into the body of the figure.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You are quite right; and it is made to pass from one extremity of its
body to the other through a small orifice, which has the same effect
as the strings in the tubes, in breaking the current and preventing
its too rapid motion. In all other respects, the principle is the same
as in the double figures.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Just as Mr. Seymour had terminated his exhibition of ‘<i>Le petit
Culbuteur</i>,’ the welcome appearance of the vicar infused fresh spirits
into the little party.</p>

<p class='c016'>“My dear friends,” said Mr. Twaddleton, “I have
<span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>been most provokingly detained by that tiresome etymologist Jeffrey
Prybabel. I made many efforts to escape, but I was as a fly in a
cobweb.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“He is the greatest bore in all Christendom; I knew him well,”
observed Mr. Seymour, “when he practised as a Conveyancer in
Gray’s-Inn, and went by the nickname of the Riot Act; for, in such
horror was he held, that, if a number of persons were congregated, his
approach was sure to disperse them. But what has been the subject of
your discourse?--was the etymologist merely airing his vocabulary, or
did he propose some difficult question for discussion? Be this,
however, as it may, I will venture to say that he was, as usual,
loquacious on the subject of <i>mutes</i>--dry on the use of <i>liquids</i>, and
descanting without end on the importance of a <i>termination</i>?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Mr. Seymour, I am really and truly ashamed of you; punning, under any
circumstances, is a most disgraceful habit, but when employed to
distort the meaning of language it becomes absolutely criminal.”</p>

<p class='c016'>To turn the subject of this discourse, the vicar proceeded to inform
Mr. Seymour that he had no sooner escaped from the fangs of Prybabel
than he encountered <i>Polyphemus</i>. Our readers may, perhaps, wonder who
this <i>Polyphemus</i> could have been; we must, therefore, inform them
that Mr. Twaddleton, whose ideas were always tinctured with classical
colouring, had bestowed this appellation upon the renowned Dr.
Doseall, the Esculapius of Overton, because, as he said, his practice
was like the Cyclops, <i>strong but blind</i>; and Mr. Seymour declared
that the similitude was even more perfect than the vicar had
contemplated, for he observed that he certainly fattened upon the
unhappy victims who fell within his clutches.</p>

<p class='c016'>With all our respect for the liberality of Mr. Seymour and the
kind-heartedness of the vicar, we must, in justice
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span>to this respectable son of Apollo, express our disapprobation at so
unprovoked a sarcasm. We acknowledge that Dr. Doseall, by the aid of
low bows and high charges--of little ailments and large potions, had
contrived to secure a very comfortable balance on the creditor side of
his worldly ledger. We also admit, that after the example of other
celebrated physicians, he had one sovereign remedy, which he
administered in every disease. But what of that? he was often
successful in his cures--that is to say, his patients sometimes
recovered <i>after</i> they had taken his physic; and is not that the test
conventionally received in proof of the skill or ignorance of greater
physicians than Dr. Doseall? Nor can we persuade ourselves into the
belief, that a doctor who faithfully adheres to one single remedy, is
less likely to be right than those restless spirits who are eternally
coquetting with all the preparations of the Pharmacopœia without
ever remaining steady to any one of them. It has been truly remarked,
that the clock which stands still and points steadfastly in one
direction, is certain of being right twice in the twenty-four hours,
while others may keep going continually, and as continually going
wrong. Being ourselves no doctors, we merely throw out this hint for
the consideration of those who are learned in such matters: but we beg
pardon of our readers for this digression.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well,” said Mr. Seymour, “I am, at all events, rejoiced to see our
Trojan in safety, after such perilous adventures; and I hope that he
is now prepared to set sail again with us, on a new voyage of
discovery. I have been engaged,” continued he, “in explaining still
farther the nature of momentum, and I now propose to exhibit an
experiment of a different kind, in order to illustrate the same
subject. You, no doubt, remember,” continued Mr. Seymour, “that
velocity makes up for weight: although, therefore, a fluid, as air, or
water, may, in a state of quiescence, be unable
<span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span>to support a body, yet, by giving it a certain velocity, it may acquire a
sustaining power. I have here several gilded pith-balls, through one
of which I have run two pins, at right angles to each other: the naked
points, you perceive, are defended with sealing-wax, to prevent any
mischief that might arise from their accidentally coming into contact
with your face. By means of this brass tube, (the stem of a
tobacco-pipe will answer the same purpose,) I shall produce a current
of air by my breath, and you will observe that the little ball will
continue to dance, as if unsupported.”</p>

<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/figp109.png' alt='Tom keeping the pith-ball aloft by blowing into the tube.' class='c040' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour then placed the pith-ball at the end of the pipe, and,
inserting its other extremity in his mouth, blew out the ball, which
immediately rose in the air, and continued to float about for several
seconds: he then drew in his breath, and caught it with much address
on one of its points; and in this manner, alternately floating and
catching it, did he continue to delight the wondering group for
several minutes.</p>

<p class='c016'>Tom received the tube and ball from the hand of his father, and soon
succeeded in playing with it. Observe, gentle reader, the address with
which the boy manages it.</p>

<p class='c016'>“This reminds me of my pea-shooter,” said Tom, as he removed the tube
from his mouth, “with which I have often shot a pea across the
play-ground.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Exactly; and you will now understand the nature of the force by which
your pea was projected. The air blown from the lungs, gains such
momentum from the contracted channel in which it flows, as to impart
considerable velocity to the pea placed within the influence of its
current.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span>Mrs. Seymour observed, that she had lately read in Waterton’s
“Wanderings in South America,” a very interesting account of the
Indian blow-pipe, which the natives of Guiana employ as an engine for
projecting their poisoned arrows, and which owes its power to the
principle of which Mr. Seymour had just spoken, and its unerring
accuracy to the skilful address of the Indian who uses it.<a href='#note10'>(10)</a></p>

<p class='c016'>“Mr. Seymour,” said the vicar, “I much like your experiment with the
pith-balls; but do tell me the use of the pins that are passed through
them.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“They are not absolutely necessary for the success of the experiment:
indeed, I ought to have stated, that their only use is to ensure the
elevation of the ball to a certain distance above the orifice of the
tube, before it is set adrift.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“‘<i>Ne turbata volent rapidis ludibria ventis</i>,’ as Virgil has it. I
duly appreciate the contrivance; but if the ball was set off at a
distance from the orifice, such an expedient would be unnecessary.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Certainly,” answered Mr. Seymour; “I will soon convince you that,
under the condition you propose, the pins are not essential.”</p>

<p class='c016'>So saying, he placed the tube in his mouth, and by carefully holding
the ball at a distance of about half an inch from its orifice, he was
enabled to consign it at once to a continuous and steady stream of
air, which can never be commanded at the point from which the air
issues; and he thus succeeded in sustaining the ball in motion, in the
same manner as he did in the preceding experiment.</p>

<p class='c016'>“We will now proceed to the orchard,” said Mr. Seymour, “where I have
prepared another pleasing exhibition of a similar description.”</p>
<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/figp111.png' alt='Man sitting at the top of a fountain’s stream of water.' class='c036' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>The party accordingly left the Lodge, and when they had arrived at the
fountain, their father produced a small wooden figure, of which the
annexed is a
<span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>sketch. Within its base was fixed a hollow sphere, or ball of thin copper,
which, when properly adjusted on a fountain, or <i>jet d’eau</i>, was
sustained by the momentum produced by the velocity of the stream; so
that the whole figure was balanced, and made to dance on the fountain,
as the pith-ball had been made to play in the current of air.</p>

<p class='c016'>The children were much gratified at witnessing so curious an
exhibition. Mr. Twaddleton laughed heartily at the ludicrous effect it
produced, and observed that, although he had never before seen the
experiment, he had frequently heard of it; and he added, that he
understood it to be a very common toy in Germany and Holland.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I have for some time,” said Mrs. Seymour, “been trying to construct a
light figure of this kind, which shall dance on a current of air; and
I believe I have at length succeeded. The head I have formed of the
seed vessel of the <i>Antirrhinum</i>, which has a striking resemblance to
a face, and possesses, moreover, the indispensable condition of
lightness. The dress is made of silver paper, stretched over a cone of
the same material. From its appearance I have named it the <i>Flying
Witch</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I admire your ingenuity,” said Mr. Seymour, “and I have no reason to
doubt the success of your enterprise.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I found it convenient,” continued Mrs. Seymour, “to place a stage of
card below the orifice of the tube, in order to steady the figure as
she rises, and to receive her as she falls.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Your principal care,” observed her husband, “must
<span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span>be to throw the centre of gravity of the figure as low as possible.”</p>

<p class='c016'>On the party returning to the library, Mr. Seymour expressed a wish
that, before they suspended their morning’s recreations, they should
take into consideration a peculiar property of matter, which they had
not yet discussed.</p>

<p class='c016'>“And what may that be?” asked Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“<span class='sc'>Elasticity</span>,” replied her father; “and I wish to hear whether Tom can
explain to us the meaning of the term.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Tom very well knew what was meant by Elasticity; but he was like many
a merchant with a bill of exchange, who, although well acquainted with
its value, has not sufficient small change to cash it. Tom wanted
words to enable him to furnish a clear definition; his father,
therefore, kindly relieved his embarrassment, by informing him that
“it was a property inherent in certain bodies, by which they possessed
a disposition to have their form altered by force or pressure, and to
recover it on the removal of that pressure, throwing off the striking
body with some degree of force: for example,” continued he, “the cane
which I hold in my hand can be bent to a certain extent, and then, if
I let it go, it will immediately return to its former condition with
considerable force.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Louisa inquired whether bending and pressing upon a body were the same
thing. Mr. Seymour replied, that the form of an elastic body might be
altered either by compression or distension, and that <i>bending</i> was,
in fact, only a combination of these two methods; “For,” said he,
“when a straight body, like my cane, is bent, those particles of it
which are on the one side are compressed, while those on the other are
distended. But let us proceed with the subject. I have said that
elastic bodies, on returning to their original form, throw off the
striking body with some degree of force.
<span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>I have here,” continued Mr. Seymour, taking out of his pocket a wooden image
of a cat, “a toy which I intend as a gift to John; it will serve to
illustrate our subject. The tail, you perceive is movable, one of its
ends being tied to a piece of catgut, which is a highly elastic
substance. When I bend the tail under the body of the animal, I
necessarily twist the string; and by pressing the other end of the
wooden tail upon a piece of wax, I can retain it for a few seconds in
that situation.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour having fixed the tail in the manner above described,
placed the wooden image on the ground, when, in a few seconds, it
suddenly sprang forward, to the great delight of the younger children.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Can you explain this action?” asked Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The wax,” answered Tom, “was incapable of holding the end of the tail
longer than a few seconds; and as soon as it was let loose, the
elasticity of the catgut enabled it to return to its former condition;
in doing which the tail struck with force against the ground, which
threw off the body of the cat and produced the leap.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Very well explained; and you, no doubt, will readily perceive that
the operation of steel springs depends upon the same principle of
elasticity: a piece of wire or steel, coiled up, may be made to set a
machine in motion by the endeavour it makes to unbend itself. This is
the principle of the spring in a watch. When our watches are what is
termed <i>down</i>, this steel has uncoiled itself; and the operation of
winding them up, is nothing more than that of bending it again for
action.<a href='#note11'>(11)</a> If the elasticity of a body be <i>perfect</i>,” added Mr.
Seymour, “it will restore itself with a force equal to that with which
it was compressed. As I have given John a toy, it is but fair that I
should reward you, Tom: open that box, and examine the gift which it
contains.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span>Tom received the present from his father, and proceeded to open the
lid, when, to his great astonishment, the figure of an old witch
suddenly sprang upwards. Mr. Seymour explained its mechanism, by
stating “that the figure contained a wire coiled up like a corkscrew,
and which, upon the removal of the pressure of the lid which confined
it, immediately regained its original form.”<a href='#note12'>(12)</a></p>

<p class='c016'>Tom inquired what kind of bodies was most elastic. He was informed
that the air was the most elastic of all known substances, and had,
for that reason, been distinguished by the name of an <i>elastic</i> fluid.
Hard bodies were so in the next degree; while soft substances which
easily retain impressions, such as clay, wax, &amp;c. might be considered
as possessing but little elasticity.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I should have thought,” said Louisa, “that neither clay nor wax had
possessed <i>any</i> elasticity.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“My love, we know not any bodies that are absolutely, or perfectly,
either hard, soft, or elastic; since all partake of these properties,
more or less, in some intermediate degree. Liquids are certainly the
least elastic of all bodies; and, until lately, water was regarded as
being perfectly inelastic;<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c017'><sup>[12]</sup></a> but recent experiments have shown it
capable of compression, and of restoring itself to its original bulk,
as soon as the pressure is removed; it must, therefore, possess some
elasticity. Indeed,” said Mr. Seymour, “we might have anticipated such
a result from the effects which present themselves in the well-known
game of ‘<i>Ricochet</i>,’ or <i>Duck and Drake</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“<i>Duck and Drake!</i>” exclaimed Louisa; “for goodness’ sake, what can
that game be?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I dare say your brother will not have any difficulty in explaining it
to you.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Tom informed her that it was a game in which any
<span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span>number of boys threw a stone, or a flat piece of tile, into the water;
and that he whose stone rebounded the greatest number of times was the
conqueror.</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is a very ancient game,” said Mr. Seymour, “and had the vicar been
present, we should have heard a learned disquisition upon it; as he,
however, is unfortunately absent, I must tell you all I know upon the
subject. It was called by the Greeks <i>Epostrakismos</i>,<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c017'><sup>[13]</sup></a> and was
anciently played with flat shells. Now it is evident that the water
must possess some degree of elasticity, or the stone could not
rebound<a href='#note13'>(13)</a>; but I shall have occasion to revert to the subject
hereafter.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And are my marbles elastic?” asked Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Undoubtedly; but not to the same extent as your ball. There,” said
Mr. Seymour, throwing his ball against the wall, “see how it
rebounds.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The return of the ball,” observed Tom, “was, I suppose, owing to its
elasticity; and I now understand why one filled with air rebounds so
much better than one stuffed with bran or wool.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You are quite right; and the return of the ball, after having struck
the wall, affords an example of what is termed <i>reflected</i> motion,
upon which I shall have to remark when we come to the interesting
subject of ‘Compound Forces;’ but at present, my only wish is to
render the property of elasticity intelligible to you. It is a force
of very extensive application; there is scarcely a machine wherein the
elasticity of one or more solids is not essentially concerned. Nature,
also, avails herself of this property to accomplish many of her
purposes. Fleas and locusts are enabled to jump two hundred times the
height of their own bodies by means of a springy membrane, easily
visible by a microscope; so that, supposing the same relative force to
be infused into the body of a man six feet
<span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span>high, he would be enabled to leap three times the height of St. Paul’s: and
the regular dispersion and sowing of the seeds of several plants is
effected by a spring, which is wound sometimes round the outside, and
at others, round the inside, of the case in which the seeds are
contained.”<a href='#note14'>(14)</a></p>

<p class='c016'>“I suppose,” said Tom, “that it is by some such spring shrimps are
enabled to leap to the tops of cataracts, as I have read in my work on
Natural History.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Many species of fish are thus enabled to leap, by bending their
bodies strongly, and then suddenly unbending them with an elastic
spring; and the long-tailed crayfish, and the common shrimp, leap by
extending their tails, after they have been bent under their
bodies:--but the most striking example of this kind is the leap of the
salmon; just under the cataract, and against the stream, he will rush
for some yards, and rise out of the spray six or eight feet; and,
amidst the noise of the water, he may be heard striking against the
rock with a sound like the clapping of hands; if he find a temporary
lodgment on the shelving rock, he will lie quivering and preparing for
another summerset, until he reaches the top of the cataract; thus at
once exhibiting the elasticity of his bones and the power of his
muscles.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“We will now conclude our diversions,” said Mr. Seymour, “with an
exhibition of a very striking description. Here,” cried he, as he
removed a small piece of apparatus from a box which stood on the
table, “is a toy, at which the sternest philosopher, nay, even
Heraclitus, of weeping memory, could not refrain from laughing.”</p>

<p class='c016'>He then displayed a small ball of Indian rubber, on which was painted
an exact resemblance of the worthy vicar, executed under the direction
of Mr. Seymour, by that inimitable artist, George Cruikshank. The ball
was connected with an air syringe, by which it was
<span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>easily distended. It gradually increased in magnitude, swelling, like the
gourd of Jonah, as the inflation proceeded, and the countenance of the
vicar progressively enlarged to the size of the full moon, without the
least alteration in the character or expression of its features.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I declare,” said Mr. Seymour, “the vicar <i>improves upon
acquaintance</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It must be acknowledged that you have <i>puffed</i> him into consequence,”
observed Mrs. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>The countenance had, after a short time, swelled to ten times its
original dimensions: the children deafened Mr. Seymour with their
shouts, and the good-humoured clergyman was actually convulsed with
laughter. The stop-cock was now turned; the elastic bladder became
smaller and smaller, and the features underwent a corresponding
diminution, until they once again assumed their original dimensions.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You perceive, my dear Sir, that I make you <i>look small</i> again.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“That is by no means an unusual effect of your jokes,” replied the
vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Now, Tom,” said his father, “it is for you to explain the nature of
the exhibition you have just witnessed.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Tom proceeded accordingly.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The bladder was highly elastic, and therefore readily yielded to the
pressure of the air, and became distended. As soon, however, as the
pressure was removed, the air was driven out again with force, and the
particles of the Indian rubber returned to their former condition. But
I observed one circumstance which I do not understand,” said Tom:
“when you first turned the stop-cock, the air rushed out with great
violence, and the ball diminished very rapidly; but it gradually
slackened, until, at last, the bladder could scarcely be seen to
contract.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I rejoice to find that you were so observant,” said
<span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span>his father: “the effect you noticed depended upon a general law of
elasticity. Elastic bodies, in the recovery of their forms from a
state of compression, after the removal of the compressing force,
exert a greater power at first than at last, so that the whole
progress of restoration is a <i>retarded</i> motion.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The vicar, who had listened with profound attention to the explanation
which the boy had offered, rushed forward at its conclusion, and
clasping him in his arms, declared, that a first-class man of Trinity
could not have succeeded better.</p>

<p class='c016'>“But let us now, if you please, Mr. Seymour, suspend our researches:
recollect,” said the vicar, “that your birds are, as yet, scarcely
fledged; and they will, therefore, make greater advances by short
flights frequently repeated, than by uninterrupted progression.”</p>

<p class='c016'>We heartily concur in this opinion, and shall, therefore, terminate
the chapter.</p>

<p class='c030'><span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span><i>The arrival of Major Snapwell, and the bustle it
occasioned.--The Vicar’s interview with the stranger.--A curious
discussion.--A word or two addressed to Fox-hunters.--Verbal
corruptions.--Some geometrical definitions.--An enigma.</i></p>

<p class='c024'>As the ladies of Overton were regaling themselves with a sociable dish
of tea and chat, the conversation was abruptly interrupted by the
appearance of a chariot-and-four, that passed along the road with
luxurious speed, and which, as Miss Kitty Ryland declared, announced,
by the dignified suavity of its roll, that the personage it conveyed
must be of superior rank.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Those,” exclaimed she, “who cannot at once distinguish such
‘spirit-stirring’ sounds from the discordant rattle of a plebeian
chaise, deserve to wear the ears of Midas.”</p>

<p class='c016'>This extraordinary subtlety of Miss Ryland’s ears is said to have been
conferred upon them by those universal promoters of bodily vigour,
<i>air</i> and <i>exercise</i>, of which they had received the combined
advantage by the ingenious habit of listening to whispers through a
certain pneumatic apparatus, familiarly termed a <i>key-hole</i>. In
farther proof of the fidelity and alertness of her auditory
establishment, we may just state, that, on passing Doseall’s shop, she
never failed to distinguish, by the sound of the mortar, whether the
medicines under preparation were designed for the stomachs of the rich
or the poor. The vicar even admitted the correctness of her
discrimination, for he had himself observed that the pestle beat
<i>dactyls</i> in one case, and <i>spondees</i> in the other.</p>

<p class='c016'>While the carriage was passing the window, the maiden companions were
breathless with wonder, each
<span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>catching a glance from the countenance of her neighbour, which heightened, as
it were, by reflection, the surprise depicted on her own.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Overton,” exclaimed Miss Noodleton, “is doubtless by this time
honoured by the arrival of some distinguished stranger; but who he is,
or what may be the object of his visit, I am at a loss to divine.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Pooh!” cried Miss Puttle; “what a fuss is here about a green carriage
and four hack horses! I doubt not but that it has conveyed some
visitor to the vicar: had the Seymours expected any company, I must
have heard of it yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“To the vicar!” exclaimed Miss Phillis Tapps; “and pray, Miss Puttle,
allow me to ask whether you ever heard of the peacock nestling with
the crow?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Or of the eagle taking up its abode in an ivy-bush?” vociferated Miss
Ryland.</p>

<p class='c016'>Conjectures were vain, and the party determined to resolve itself into
a committee of inquiry. In the first place, it was judged expedient to
see and question Ralph Spindle, whom Dr. Doseall employed on the
arrival of a stranger, as certain insects are said to use their
‘<i>feelers</i>’ to discover the approach of any prey that may serve them
as food.</p>

<p class='c016'>The stranger was soon discovered to be a Major Snapwell, a rich and
eccentric old bachelor, who had served in various campaigns in
different parts of the globe, and received a competent number of
wounds, in the defence of his king and country. His income was
reported to be large, and it was said, that he had not any near
relative to enjoy the reversion, since his nephew had perished about
two years before by shipwreck. The circumstances that led to this
disastrous event were believed to have so affected the veteran, as to
have occasioned a very serious illness, and a consequent state of
despondency, for which his physicians advised a constant change of
scene; so that he had been rambling about the Continent during the
last
<span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span>year and a half, accompanied only by his faithful servant, Jacob Watson,
who was as much attached to the Major, as was ever a Newfoundland dog
to his master.</p>

<p class='c016'>Such was the information derived from Annette, the vicar’s
housekeeper: what proportion of fiction was mingled with its truth,
the reader will probably soon be able to discover.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well, Jacob,” said the Major, as his trusty but asthmatic valet was
leisurely buttoning on the long gaiters of his master the morning
after his arrival, “what do you hear about this village of Overton?
Are there any sociable neighbours? I like the country; it is
beautiful, Jacob, and the air appears mild: it promises to be the very
place to kindle the sparks of my expiring constitution; and should
you, at the same time, get your broken-winded bellows mended, my vital
flame might, perhaps, burn a little brighter. But tell me, what do you
hear of it, Jacob?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Why, and please you, Major, I just now met an old crony of mine, Mrs.
Annette Brown, at the Devil and the Bag of Nails----”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And pray, Jacob,” exclaimed the Major, “who taught you to speak thus
irreverently of the village blacksmith?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The village blacksmith! Lord love you, it is the sign of the village
alehouse!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Then it is a very odd one; but go on with your story.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“As I was saying, Major, I met an old acquaintance who is housekeeper
to Mr. Twaddleton, a bachelor gentleman, and the vicar of the parish.
She tells me her master is downright adored in the place: though he
must needs be a queer mortal, for she says he is so fond of <i>antics</i>
that he won’t suffer a mop or broom in his house, lest, I suppose, it
should spoil the hopping of the fleas, and put an end to the fly’s
rope-dance upon a cobweb.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span>“Jacob, Jacob, you are a wag, and had better go and offer your
services to this merry parson; although, I fear, your asthmatic pipes
would prove but a sorry accompaniment to his capering. But
pshaw!--fiddlestick!--stuff and nonsense!--who ever heard of a vicar
being fond of antics!--you are imposed upon, Jacob.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I am sure that how Annette told me as much. Ay, and she said he had
all sorts of <i>curiosities</i> in his parlour--such as grinning faces,
dogs with three heads, rusty swords, and I do not know what besides.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I see it!--see it all plainly!” exclaimed the Major; “and your story
has so delighted me that I could almost dance myself.” This
respectable clergyman, thought he, is, doubtless, an antiquary, a
virtuoso--what a delightful companion will he prove! And a bachelor
like myself!--what <i>tête-à-têtes</i> do I anticipate!</p>

<p class='c016'>“Jacob,” exclaimed the Major, “you should have said that the vicar was
fond of, or, to speak more correctly, devoted to <i>antiques</i>, not to
<i>antics</i>. But, tell me whether there are any other agreeable persons
in this village?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“There’s the squire and his family,” answered the valet.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The name, the name, Jacob?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Squire Seymour, and please you, Major.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Seymour, Seymour!” repeated the Major; “I seem to know that name--let
me remember.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The Major’s cogitations, however, were abruptly cut short by the
entrance of the servant-maid, who informed him that Mr. Vicar
Twaddleton had called.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I beg that Mr. Twaddleton may be admitted.--Jacob, place a chair.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Mr. Twaddleton,” said the Major, as he advanced towards the door to
meet his visitor, “I feel obliged and honoured by your kind attention.
As a perfect
<span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span>stranger, I could scarcely have expected this civility; but your village,
surrounded as it is by all the softer charms of Nature, is calculated
to impress the hearts of its inhabitants with a kindred amenity. The
inhabitants are, doubtless, much attached to their country.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Proverbially so: never was Ulysses more attached to his Ithaca! Allow
me, also, to say that we all rejoice at the arrival of visitors; and,
as vicar of the parish of Overton, I should consider myself criminally
deficient in my duty were I to suffer a respectable stranger to depart
from us without his having received the mark of my respect, and the
tender of my humble but cordial hospitality. I am an old-fashioned
person, Major Snapwell, and am well aware that these antiquated
notions do not altogether accord with the cold and studied forms of
the present day.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Mr. Twaddleton,” exclaimed the delighted Major, “I thank thee, most
heartily thank thee, in the name of all those whose hearts have not
yet been benumbed by worldly indifference. Sit thee down--I abhor
ceremony--and let me beg of you not to take offence at a question to
which I am most anxious you should give me an answer. Are you, my dear
Sir, as I have just reasons for supposing, an <span class='sc'>Antiquary</span>?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I am undoubtedly attached to pursuits which might have favoured such
a report.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I thought so; I guessed as much. Then give me your hand; we must be
friends and associates. If there be a pursuit on earth to which I am
devotedly attached, it is to that of antiquities; and, let me add,”
continued the Major with increasing animation, for, like bottled beer,
he was the brisker for warmth, “that if there be a literary character
to whom the professor of arms ought to feel superior gratitude, it is
to the antiquary. How many victories, what valiant deeds, must have
perished in the memory of mankind
<span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span>but for the kind offices of the virtuoso! under whose vivifying touch the
laurels of the victor have bloomed with renovated vigour! and when the
scythe of Time has left them to wither, and to be scattered on the
wings of the wind, he collects their remains, and piously deposits
them in a splendid mausoleum, in order to preserve them to the latest
posterity!”</p>

<p class='c016'>It were difficult to say, whether astonishment at the Major’s warmth,
delight at the congenial sentiments he had expressed, or admiration at
the language in which they had been conveyed, was the feeling
predominant in the vicar’s mind, nor do we deem it necessary to
inquire; suffice it to say, that, from the conversation of a few
minutes, these two gentlemen felt incited to a mutual regard by
sympathy and congeniality of soul; so true is it that, while we may be
strangers with the companions of years, we may become friends with the
strangers of yesterday!</p>

<p class='c016'>“Major Snapwell,” said the vicar, “I may truly mark this day in the
diary of my life in red letters; your society will add to my
happiness, by extending the sphere of my literary intercourse. When
may I expect the pleasure of your company at the vicarage? I am really
impatient to show you my coins and a few dainty morsels of <i>virtù</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I shall be at your service to-morrow,” answered the Major; “but I
must now say something about my plans, for it is possible that you may
assist me in carrying them into execution.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Command me,” said the vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>“For my present purpose, it is only necessary to state, that I have a
nephew whom I have adopted as my son; I superintended his education;
he arrived at manhood, and became an accomplished scholar and a
polished gentleman. Naturally anxious to visit the ancient mistress of
the world, he readily obtained my approbation of his plan. He embarked
at Marseilles; but, meeting with one of those treacherous gales so
<span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span>characteristic of the Mediterranean, he was shipwrecked in the bay of
Genoa. For three years did I mourn him as dead, and it was only by a
train of circumstances of the most extraordinary description that I at
length discovered him to be living. I will not now trouble you with
the details of this most singular history; suffice it to say he is now
well, and about to be married to a young lady for whom he has long
entertained the purest attachment. I am in search of a country
residence for them, and hearing that a Sir Thomas Sotherby, a
resident, I understand, in your neighbourhood, is most desirous of
disposing of Osterley Park, and offers many advantages to any one who
will take it off his hands, and as I have both the inclination and the
means to become its possessor, I have travelled hither for the purpose
of inspecting it. So now you have my history.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is perfectly true,” said the vicar, “that Sir Thomas is willing to
make a considerable sacrifice in order to obtain an immediate
purchaser. The health of her Ladyship is in so precarious a state that
her physicians have ordered her to proceed, without delay, to Madeira.
Sir Thomas, Major, is a fox-hunter, and I will venture to say that no
one will miss him but the doctor and the foxes--the one will lose a
profitable friend, the other a relentless enemy--‘<i>Gaudet equis et
canibus</i>,’ as the poet has it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Indeed! but I am no fox-hunter, and I therefore fear that, in the
opinion of the country, Osterley Park will not exchange its proprietor
to advantage. Pray, vicar, may I ask whether you are addicted to
field-sports?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Addicted to field-sports!” repeated the reverend antiquary: “I am
surprised, mortified, absolutely shocked! I--I addicted to
field-sports!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Nay, Mr. Twaddleton,” observed the Major, “I am really sorry that I
should have unintentionally excited your indignation. I am not aware
that there
<span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span>is anything in the innocent pastime to which I have alluded inconsistent
with your station and acquirements. As an antiquary, I need hardly
remind you that the fathers of the Church were amongst the keenest
sportsmen. Do you not remember the amusing portrait which Chaucer has
given us of a sporting monastic in the 14th century, and which, by the
by, was the model from which Sir Walter Scott drew the character of
his Abbot in ‘Ivanhoe?’ Then again, need I call to your recollection
the fame of Walter, Archdeacon of Canterbury, who was promoted to the
see of Rochester in 1147, and who is said not only to have spent the
whole of his time in hunting, but to have been as keen a sportsman at
eighty as he was at twenty years of age? Then again, there was
Reginald Brian, translated to the see of Worcester in 1352; and
William de Clowne, whom his biographer celebrated as the most amiable
ecclesiastic that ever filled the abbot’s throne of St. Mary in
Leicestershire, the most knowing sportsman after a hare in the
kingdom; insomuch, indeed, that Richard II. and his son allowed him
annual pensions for his instructions in the art?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Major Snapwell, antiquity can no more privilege error, than novelty
can prejudice truth,” exclaimed the vicar: “but, to be serious,”
continued he, “I never could discover the principle upon which the
pleasure of this said diversion of Diana can depend; and yet I do
assure you, sir, that I have not failed to submit the question to a
logical examination. Thus, for instance:--the fox emits from his body
certain odorous particles;--that is my <i>major</i>, and I say <i>concedo</i>:
very well; I proceed. The structure of the olfactory organs of the
canine species enables them to perceive this said odour: that is my
<i>minor</i>, and I say again <i>concedo</i>. But I should much like to be
informed how any logician can defend the consequence which is deduced
from these premises. To speak more syllogistically,
<span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span>why am I pleased to put my neck in jeopardy, <i>because</i> my dogs happen to
perceive a smell?”</p>

<p class='c016'>The Major laughed heartily at the very ludicrous point of view in
which the worthy vicar had thought proper to represent the subject.
Their discourse now took a different turn. The Major inquired what
might be the origin of the singular sign of the village inn--<i>The
Devil and the Bag of Nails?</i> “Satan,” continued the Major, “is
unquestionably the patron of the public-house; but why he should be
represented as holding in his hand a bag of nails, I cannot divine,
unless, indeed, in reference to the old adage, that ‘<i>Every glass of
spirit is a nail in your coffin.</i>’”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Ha! ha! ha! whimsical enough,” cried the vicar; “but, unfortunately,
your explanation is not the true one. The sign,” observed Mr.
Twaddleton, “is not quite so uncommon as you seem to suppose; it was
originally ‘<i>Pan and his Bacchanals</i>,’ but, by a very natural
transition, the figure of the sylvan deity, which is certainly
terrific<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c017'><sup>[14]</sup></a> enough to sanction the mistake, has passed into that of
the evil tempter; while the word <i>Bacchanals</i>, by one of those verbal
corruptions so common in all languages, has been converted into the
<i>bag of nails</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Very true,” said the Major; “whenever the vulgar are incapable of
understanding the meaning of a word, they are sure to substitute for
it some one which has the nearest resemblance to it in sound, and
which is more familiar to them. I had but just now an excellent
instance of this kind: my blundering servant Jacob insisted upon it
that you were fond of <i>antics</i>; and before I left London, on sending
him out to purchase a <i>Court Calendar</i>, what do you suppose he brought
home?--a <i>Quart Colander</i>!”</p>

<p class='c016'>The vicar was much amused by the absurdity of the mistake.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span>“I lately heard,” continued the Major, “of a Welsh squire, who, upon
being questioned whether <i>Socinianism</i> or <i>Arianism</i> prevailed in his
district, replied, that he could not answer that question, but that he
knew there had been a great deal of <i>Rheumatism</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>But the good company of the Major and his newly acquired friend must
not detain us any longer from our duty. Mr. Seymour and his young
family have reassembled in the library, and it is necessary that we
should immediately join them. Some of our readers may, perhaps,
decline accompanying us upon this occasion; for the subject to be
discussed, however necessary it may be, is certainly not so
entertaining as many of those which have engaged our attention. If
this be the case, they may make a short cut, and join us again at the
beginning of the following chapter. The children had arranged
themselves around the table, when their father observed, that it would
be necessary for their future progress, to devote an hour or two to
the consideration of several mathematical figures and terms.</p>

<p class='c016'>“As to mathematical figures,” said Tom, “if you allude to squares,
circles, and figures of that description, and to parallel lines,
angles, and so on, I can assure you that I am already well acquainted
with them; for the work you have given us on <span class='sc'>Papyro-Plastics</span><a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c017'><sup>[15]</sup></a> has
fully instructed me in those particulars.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“If that be the case,” replied Mr. Seymour, “you will not have any
difficulty in answering my questions; but we must, nevertheless, go
regularly through the subject, for the sake of your sisters, who may
not be equally proficient in this elementary part of geometry:
<span class='pageno' title='112' id='Page_112'></span>tell me, therefore, in the first place, what is meant by a
<i>parallelogram</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“A four-sided figure,” answered Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“That is true; but are there not some other conditions annexed to it?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Yes; its opposite sides are parallel.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And what do you understand by the term <i>parallel</i>?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Lines are said to be parallel,” said Tom, “when they are always at
the same distance from each other, and which, therefore, can never
meet, though ever so far continued.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You are quite right. What is a <i>square</i>?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“A four-sided figure, in which the sides are all equal, and its angles
all right angles.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Good again: but let me see whether you have a correct notion of the
nature of an angle.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“An angle is the opening formed by two lines meeting in a point.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour here acknowledged himself perfectly satisfied with his
son’s answers, and said, that he should accordingly direct his
attention more particularly to Louisa and Fanny; and, taking his
pencil, he sketched the annexed figure.</p>

<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/figvi01.png' alt='Figure 1. Circle with two lines running through it.' class='c042' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>“You perceive, Louisa,” said her father, “that the line <b><span class='fss'>A C</span></b> makes two
angles with the line <b><span class='fss'>B D</span></b>, viz. the angle <b><span class='fss'>A C D</span></b> and the angle <b><span class='fss'>A C B</span></b>;
and you perceive that these two angles are equal to each other.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“How can they be equal?” cried Fanny, “for the lines are of very
different lengths.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“An angle, my dear girl, is not measured by the <i>length</i> of the lines,
but by their <i>opening</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“But surely,” said Louisa, “that amounts to the
<span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span>same thing: for the longer the lines are, the greater must be the opening
between them.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Take the pair of compasses,” replied her father, “and describe a
circle around these angles, making the angular point <b><span class='fss'>C</span></b> its centre.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“To what extent am I to open them?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“That is quite immaterial; you may draw your circle of any magnitude
you please, provided it cuts both the lines of the angles we are about
to measure. All circles, of whatever dimensions, are supposed to be
divided into 360 parts, called <i>degrees</i>; the size, but not the
number, of such degrees will therefore increase with the magnitude of
the circle. And since the opening of an angle is necessarily a portion
of a circle, it must embrace a certain number of degrees; and two
angles are, accordingly, said to be equal, when they contain an equal
number of them.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Now I understand it,” said Louisa: “as the dimensions of an angle
depend upon the number of degrees contained between its lines, it
evidently must be the <i>opening</i>, and not the <i>length</i> of the lines,
that determines the measure of the angle.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Say, rather, the <i>value</i> of the angle, for that is the usual
expression: but I perceive you understand me; tell me, therefore, how
many degrees are contained in each of the two angles formed by one
line falling perpendicularly on another, as in the above figure.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I perceive that the two angles together are just equal to half the
circle; and, since you say that the whole circle is divided into 360
degrees, each angle must measure 90 of them, or the two together make
up 180.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You are quite right, and I beg you to remember, that an angle of 90
degrees, is called a <i>right</i> angle, and that, when one line is
perpendicular to another, it will always form, as you have just seen,
a right angle on either side.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I now understand,” said Louisa, “what is meant
<span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span>BY lines being at <i>right angles to each other</i>: But, papa,” continued
she, “what are <i>obtuse</i> and <i>acute</i> angles, of which I have so often
heard you speak?”</p>

<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/figvi02.png' alt='Figure 2. An acute (A) and an obtuse (B) angle.' class='c040' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour replied, that he could better explain their nature by a
drawing, than by any verbal description. “Here,” said he, “is an acute
angle, <b><span class='fss'>A</span></b>; and here an obtuse one, <b><span class='fss'>B</span></b>: the former, you perceive, is one
that contains less than 90 degrees; the latter, one which contains
more, and is consequently greater than a right angle.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Louisa fully comprehended the explanation, and observed, that she
should remember, whenever an angle measured less than a <i>right</i> angle,
that it was <i>acute</i>, and when more, <i>obtuse</i>. “But you have not yet
explained to me,” she continued, “the meaning of a <i>triangle</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“That is a term denoting a figure of three sides, and angles. I dare
say Tom can describe the several kinds of triangles.”</p>

<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/figvi03.png' alt='Figure 3. Three triangles, labeled A, B, and C.' class='c040' />
</div>
<p class='c016'>Tom accordingly took the pencil, and drew a set of figures, of which
the annexed are faithful copies.</p>

<p class='c016'>“<b><span class='fss'>A</span></b>,” said he, “is an <i>Equi-lateral</i> triangle; its three sides being
all equal. <b><span class='fss'>B</span></b> is a <i>Right-angled</i> triangle, having one right angle. <b><span class='fss'>C</span></b>
represents an <i>Obtuse-angled</i> triangle, it having one obtuse angle. An
<i>Acute-angled</i> triangle is one in which all the three angles are
acute, as represented in figure <b><span class='fss'>A</span></b>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“As you have succeeded so well in your explanation of a triangle, let
us see whether you can describe the nature of a circle.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is a round line, every part of which is equally distant from the
centre.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And which round line,” said Mr. Seymour, “is
<span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span>frequently called the <i>circumference</i>. What is the diameter?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“A straight line drawn through the centre, and terminating in the
circumference on both sides.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And an arc?” said Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Any portion of the circumference.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Now let me ask you, what name is given to a line which joins any two
opposite angles of a four-sided figure?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The <i>diagonal</i>, papa.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You are quite right,” said Mr. Seymour; and, turning towards the
girls, he desired them to remember that term, as they would frequently
hear it mentioned during their investigation into the nature of
“Compound Forces.” “I really think,” continued their father, “that Tom
is as capable of instructing you in these elementary principles as
myself; I shall, therefore, desire you, my dear boy, to conclude this
lecture during my absence; remember, that by teaching others we always
instruct ourselves: but before I quit you, I will give you a riddle to
solve, for I well know that you all delight in an enigma.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Indeed do we,” said Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Pray let us hear it, papa,” cried Fanny.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour then recited the following lines, which he had hastily
composed; the point having, no doubt, been suggested on the instant,
by the remark he had just offered.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c043'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><b>“Here’s a riddle for those who delight in their gold,</b></div>
      <div class='line'><b>Which they p’rhaps may explain, when my story is told;</b></div>
      <div class='line'><b>No treasure’s so precious, and yet those who gain me,</b></div>
      <div class='line'><b>Though they give me away, will always retain me!</b></div>
      <div class='line'><b>Indeed, if they wish to increase their rich store,</b></div>

      <div class='line'><b>You do not possess me--I hope that you may.”</b></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span>“Why,” cried Tom, “what can that be, of which the more we give away,
the more we have left?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Ay,” added Louisa, “and that we actually <i>increase</i> the store, by
<i>giving away</i> a part of it!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is some word, I think,” observed Fanny; “do you not remember that
mamma asked us what that was, from which we might take away <i>some</i>,
and yet that the <i>whole</i> would remain?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“To be sure,” cried Tom, “I remember it well; it was the word
<i>wholesome</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour here assured them, that the enigma they had just heard,
did not depend upon any verbal quibble; and that as the object of its
introduction was to instruct, rather than to puzzle them, he would
explain it, and leave them to extract its moral, and profit by its
application.</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is <b><span class='sc'>Knowledge</span></b>,” said he.</p>

<p class='c016'>“‘<i>No treasure’s so precious</i>,’” repeated Louisa; “certainly
none;--‘<i>and yet those who gain me, though they give me away, will
always retain me</i>;’--to be sure,” added she. “How could I have been so
simple as not to have guessed it? We can certainly impart all the
knowledge we possess, and yet not lose any of it ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“By instructing others,” said Mr. Seymour, “we are certain, at the
same time, of instructing ourselves, and thus to increase our store of
knowledge. Let this truth be impressed upon your memory, and, after
our conversations, examine each other as to the knowledge you have
gained by them: you will thus not only fix the facts more strongly in
your recollection, but you will acquire a facility of conversing in
philosophical language.”</p>

Motion.--Rotatory Motion.--The Revolving Watch-glass.--The
Sling.--The Centrifugal and Centripetal Forces.--Theory of
Projectiles.--A Geological conversation between Mr. Seymour and
the Vicar.</i></p>
<p class='c024'>On the following morning, Mr. Seymour proceeded to explain the nature
of “<span class='sc'>Compound Forces</span>.” The young party having assembled as usual, their
father commenced his lecture by reminding his auditors, that the
motion of a body actuated by a single force was always in a right
line, and in the direction in which it received the impulse.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Do you mean to say, papa, that a single force can never make a body
move round, or in a crooked direction; if so, how is it that my ball,
or marble, will frequently run along the ground in a curved direction?
Indeed, I always find it very difficult to make it go straight.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Depend upon it, my dear, whenever the direction of a moving body
deviates from a straight line, it has been influenced by some second
force.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Then I suppose that, whenever my marble runs in a curved line, there
must be some second force to make it do so.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Undoubtedly; the inequality of the ground may give it a new
direction; which, when combined with the original force which it
received from your hand, will fully explain the irregularity of its
course. It is to the consideration of such compound motion that I am
now desirous of directing your attention: the subject is termed the
“<span class='sc'>Composition of Forces</span>.” Here is a block of wood, with two strings, as
you may perceive,
<span class='pageno' title='118' id='Page_118'></span>affixed to it: do you take hold of one of these strings, Louisa; and you, Tom,
of the other. That is right. Now place the block at one of the corners
or <i>angles</i> of the table: and while Tom draws it along one of its
sides, do you, Louisa, at the same time, draw it along the other.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The children obeyed their father’s directions.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id010'>
<img src='images/figp135.png' alt='A piece of wood with two strings attached to it, and two hands pulling the strings in diagonal directions.' class='ig010' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>“See!” said Mr. Seymour, “the block obeys neither of the strings, but
picks out for itself a path which is intermediate. Can you tell me,
Tom, the exact direction which it takes?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“If we consider this table as a parallelogram, I should say, that the
block described the diagonal.”</p>

<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/figvii04.png' alt='Figure 4. Force diagram for a ball moving in a diagonal direction.' class='c036' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>“Well said, my boy; the ablest mathematician could not have given a
more correct answer. The block was actuated by two forces at the same
time; and, since it could not move in two directions at once, it moved
under the <i>compound</i> force, in a mean or diagonal direction,
proportioned to the influence of the joint forces acting upon it. You
will, therefore, be pleased to remember, it is a general law, that
where a body is actuated by two forces at the same time, whose
directions are inclined to each other, at any angle whatever, it will
not obey either of them, but move along the diagonal. In determining,
therefore, the course
<span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span>which a body will describe under the influence of two such forces, we have
nothing more to do than to draw lines which show the direction and
quantity of the two forces, and then to complete the parallelogram by
parallel lines, and its diagonal will be the path of the body. I have
here a diagram which may render the subject more intelligible. Suppose
the ball <b><span class='fss'>B</span></b> were, at the same moment, struck by two forces <b><span class='fss'>X</span></b> and <b><span class='fss'>Y</span></b> in
the directions <b><span class='fss'>B A</span></b> and <b><span class='fss'>B D</span></b>. It is evident that the ball would not obey
either of such forces, but would move along the oblique or diagonal
line <b><span class='fss'>B C</span></b>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“But,” said Tom, “why have you drawn the line <b><span class='fss'>B D</span></b> so much longer than
<b><span class='fss'>B A</span></b>?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I am glad you have asked that question. Lines are intended, not only
to represent the direction, but the <i>momenta</i>, or quantities of the
forces: the line <b><span class='fss'>B D</span></b> is, as you observe, twice as long as <b><span class='fss'>B A</span></b>; it
consequently denotes that the force <b><span class='fss'>Y</span></b> acting in the direction <b><span class='fss'>B D</span></b>, is
twice as great as the force <b><span class='fss'>X</span></b> acting in the direction <b><span class='fss'>B A</span></b>. Having
learned the direction which the body will take when influenced by
joint forces of this kind, can you tell me the relative time which it
would require for the performance of its diagonal journey?”</p>

<p class='c016'>Tom hesitated; and Mr. Seymour relieved his embarrassment by informing
him, that it would pass along the diagonal in exactly the same space
of time that it would have required to traverse either of the sides of
the parallelogram, had but one force been applied. Thus, the ball <b><span class='fss'>B</span></b>
would reach <b><span class='fss'>C</span></b> in the same time that the force <b><span class='fss'>X</span></b> would have sent it to
<b><span class='fss'>A</span></b>, or the force <b><span class='fss'>Y</span></b> to <b><span class='fss'>D</span></b>. “I will endeavour to prove this fact beyond
all doubt. It is, I think, evident, that the force which acts in the
direction <b><span class='fss'>B A</span></b> can neither accelerate nor retard the approach of the
body to the line <b><span class='fss'>D C</span></b>, which is parallel to
<span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span>it; hence it will arrive at <b><span class='fss'>C</span></b> in the same time that it would have done had
no motion been communicated to it in the direction <b><span class='fss'>B A</span></b>. In like
manner, the motion in the direction <b><span class='fss'>B D</span></b> can neither make the body
approach to nor recede from <b><span class='fss'>A C</span></b>; and it therefore follows, that, in
consequence of the two motions, the body will be found both in <b><span class='fss'>A C</span></b> and
<b><span class='fss'>C D</span></b>, and will therefore be found in <b><span class='fss'>C</span></b>, the point of intersection.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Louisa seemed to express by her looks the irksomeness of such
demonstrations; and which did not pass unobserved.</p>

<p class='c016'>“This may appear tedious and uninteresting,” said Mr. Seymour, “but
the information is absolutely essential to our future progress: if you
would reap, you must sow.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Tom and Louisa both expressed themselves willing to receive whatever
instruction their father might consider necessary; and they farther
declared, that they understood the demonstration he had just offered
them.</p>

<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/figvii05.png' alt='Figure 5. Diagram of forces as parallelogram flattens.' class='c039' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>“Is it not then evident,” proceeded Mr. Seymour, “that the composition
of forces must always be attended with loss of power; since the
diagonal of a parallelogram can never, under any circumstances, be
equal to two of its sides? and is it not also evident, that the length
of the diagonal must diminish as the angles of the sides increase: so
that the more acute the angle at which the forces act, the less must
be the loss by composition? But I shall be better able to explain this
law by a diagram. If <b><span class='fss'>B A</span></b>, <b><span class='fss'>A C</span></b> be the sides of a parallelogram,
representing the direction of two forces, and <b><span class='fss'>A D</span></b> the diagonal path of
the body, is it not evident that the line <b><span class='fss'>A D</span></b> will shorten as the
angle <b><span class='fss'>B A C</span></b> increases?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“We see that at once,” cried Tom, “from the diagram before us.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span></p>
<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/figvii06.png' alt='Figure 6. A square and a rectangle with a common diagonal.' class='c036' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>“Then we will proceed to another fact connected with the same subject.
Look at this diagram; is not the diagonal <b><span class='fss'>A D</span></b> common to both the
parallelograms inscribed about it, viz. of <b><span class='fss'>A B C D</span></b>, and <b><span class='fss'>A E F D</span></b>?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“To be sure it is.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Then it is equally clear, that a body may be made to traverse the
same path <b><span class='fss'>A D</span></b>, by any pair of forces represented by the adjacent sides
of either of such parallelograms.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Undoubtedly.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I request you to keep that fact in your recollection.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I have now to inform you,” continued he, “that a single force may be
resolved into any number of forces, and may, in fact, be regarded as
compounded of innumerable oblique ones. In order, however, to render
this fact more intelligible, I must refer you to <i>fig.</i> 6, from which
it will appear that the motion of a body, along the line <b><span class='fss'>A D</span></b>, will be
the same whether it arise from one single force acting in that
direction, or from two forces impressed upon it in the directions <b><span class='fss'>A B</span></b>,
<b><span class='fss'>A C</span></b>, or in those of <b><span class='fss'>A E</span></b>, <b><span class='fss'>A F</span></b>; and, consequently, although the motion
may, in reality, be the effect of a single force, yet it may be
considered as compounded of two or more in other directions, since the
very same motion would arise from such a composition.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Tom acknowledged the truth of this statement; and Mr. Seymour assured
him, that, when they came to play at ball and marbles, he should be
able to give him a practical demonstration of the fact; for he would
show him, that whenever a body strikes a surface obliquely, or in an
inclined direction, such a <i>resolution of force</i> will actually take
place: “and now, Tom,” said his father, “give me a marble; for I wish
to explain the reason why it turns round, or revolves on its axis, as
it proceeds forward.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'></span>“I suppose,” said Tom, “it depends upon the action which I give to it
by my thumb and finger when I shoot it out of my hand.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You are, undoubtedly, capable of thus giving to your marble a certain
<i>spinning</i> motion, the effect of which we shall have to consider
hereafter; but I fancy you would be greatly puzzled to make it proceed
without revolving, give it what impulse you might by your hand.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I have sometimes tried,” said Tom, “to make it do so by pushing it
along with a flat ruler, but it always <i>rolled</i> in spite of me.”</p>

<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/figvii07.png' alt='Figure 7. Diagram for motion of marble.' class='c035' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>“Then it is clear, from your own experiment, that its rotation cannot
arise from the cause you would assign to it. If you will attend to
this diagram,” continued his father, “I will endeavour to explain the
operation. It is evident that, as the marble moves along the ground <b><span class='fss'>B D</span></b>,
the motion of the point <b><span class='fss'>B</span></b> will be retarded by the resistance
occasioned by its rubbing on the ground; while the point <b><span class='fss'>C</span></b>, which does
not meet with any such resistance, is carried forward without
opposition, and it consequently must move faster than the point <b><span class='fss'>B</span></b>; but
since all the parts of the marble cohere or stick together, the point
<b><span class='fss'>C</span></b> cannot move faster than <b><span class='fss'>B</span></b>, unless the marble revolves from <b><span class='fss'>C</span></b> to <b><span class='fss'>E</span></b>;
and as the several points of the marble which are successively applied
to the floor are retarded in their motion, while the opposite points
move freely, the marble during its progressive motion must continue to
revolve.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“But you said, papa, that whenever a body moved in any direction,
except that of a straight line, it must have been acted upon by more
than one force; and yet the marble not only runs along the ground,
but
<span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>turns round; at the same time, by the simple force of my hand.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The revolution of the marble, my dear boy, is brought about by no
less than three forces: look attentively at the diagram, and you will
easily comprehend my explanation. There is, in the first place, the
rectilinear motion given to it by your hand; then there is the
friction of the ground: since, however, this latter acts in a contrary
direction, it merely tends to lessen or counteract the velocity with
which the under-surface proceeds, and consequently to give a
relatively-increased progressive motion to its upper part; then comes
that force by which its several parts cohere, and which may be
represented by <b><span class='fss'>C H</span></b>; so that the two forces producing the revolution of
the point <b><span class='fss'>C</span></b>, are justly expressed by the lines <b><span class='fss'>C G</span></b>, <b><span class='fss'>C H</span></b>: but these are
in the direction of the two sides of a parallelogram, the point will
therefore move along the diagonal <b><span class='fss'>C E</span></b>. I have here a toy for you,
which will serve to explain still farther the causes of rotation to
which I have alluded.” Mr. Seymour produced a watch-glass, in the
hollow of which stood a dancing-figure of thin card, as here
represented.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id011'>
<img src='images/figp140.png' alt='Toy man standing on the flat part of a convex piece of glass.' class='ig011' />
</div>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='124' id='Page_124'></span>He placed it upon a black japanned waiter,<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c017'><sup>[16]</sup></a> which he held in an
inclined position, when it immediately slided down the inclined plane,
as might have been expected. He next let fall a drop of water upon the
waiter, and placed the watch-glass in it. Under this new arrangement,
instead of sliding, the watch-glass began to revolve as soon as an
inclination was given to the surface; and it continued to revolve with
an accelerated velocity, obeying the inclination and position of the
plane, as directed by the hand of the operator.</p>

<p class='c016'>“What a very pretty effect is produced by the rapid revolution of the
figure!” observed Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Its use in the arrangement,” said her father, “is to render the
accelerated motion more obvious.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I perceive it revolves faster and faster, or, I suppose I ought to
say, with an accelerated velocity,” said Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Certainly,” answered Mr. Seymour; “whenever a force continues to act,
the motion produced by it must be accelerated for the reason already
given you<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c017'><sup>[17]</sup></a>--but let me explain the operation of the drop of water,
which, as you have just seen, converted the sliding into the revolving
motion. In the first place, in consequence of the cohesion of the
water to the two surfaces, a new force was introduced, by which an
unequal degree of resistance was imparted to different portions of
that part of the watch-glass in contact with the plane, and,
consequently, in its effort to slide down, it necessarily revolved.
Now, if you will attentively observe the change of figure which the
drop of water undergoes during the revolution of the glass, you will
perceive a species of vortex; a film of water,
<span class='pageno' title='125' id='Page_125'></span>by capillary action, is drawn to the foremost portion of the glass,
while, by the centrifugal force, a body of water is thrown under the
hinder part of it; the effect of both these actions is to accelerate
the rotatory motion.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I shall now dismiss the subject for the present, but on some future
occasion I shall probably revert to it; for it may be made to afford a
simple illustration of the rotatory and progressive motions of the
earth round the sun; and it may also give us the means of producing
some optical effects of a very curious kind.”<a href='#note15'>(15)</a></p>

<p class='c016'>Mrs. Seymour here suggested that, as it was past one o’clock, the
children should be dismissed to their more active sports in the
garden.</p>

<p class='c016'>“We will instantly proceed to the lawn,” replied Mr. Seymour, “and Tom
may try his skill with the <i>sling</i>; an amusement which I have provided
as a reward for his industry, and which will, at the same time, convey
some farther information concerning the nature of those forces we have
been just considering. The sling,” continued his father, as he
advanced upon the lawn, “consists, as you perceive, of a leathern
thong, broadest in the middle, and tapering off gradually towards both
ends. To each extremity is affixed a piece of string. I shall now
place a stone in the broad part of the leather, and introduce my
middle finger into the loop formed in one of the strings, and hold the
other extremity between my fore-finger and thumb.”</p>

<p class='c016'>He then whirled it round, and when it had gained sufficient impetus,
he let go his hold of the string, and the stone instantly shot forth
with amazing velocity.</p>

<p class='c016'>“See! see! there it goes,” exclaimed Tom; “to what a height it
ascended!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And to what a distance has it been projected!” observed Louisa, who
had attentively watched its descent.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span>“Now, Tom,” said his father, “can you explain the operation you have
just witnessed?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Not exactly, papa.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Then attend to me. Have you not learned that circular motion is
always the result of two forces?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Undoubtedly,” replied Tom; “of one force which attracts it to the
centre around which it moves, and of another which impels it to move
off in a right line.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Certainly; the former of these forces is, therefore, termed the
<i>centripetal</i>, because it draws the body towards the centre, while the
latter is called the <i>centrifugal</i> force, since its influence disposes
the body to fly off from the centre. In circular motion, these two
forces constantly balance each other; otherwise it is evident that the
revolving body must either approach the centre or recede from it,
according as the one or the other prevailed. When I whirled round the
sling, I imparted a projectile force to the stone, but it was
prevented from flying off in consequence of the counteracting or
<i>centripetal</i> force of the string; but the moment I let go my hold of
this, the stone flew off in a right line: having been released from
confinement to the fixed or central point, it was acted upon by one
force only, and motion produced by a single force is, as you have just
stated, always in a right line.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“But,” observed Louisa, “the stone did not proceed in a straight, but
in a curved line: I watched its direction from the moment it left the
sling till it fell to the ground.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You are perfectly correct,” replied Mr. Seymour, “it described a
curve, which is called a <i>parabola</i>; but that was owing to the
influence of a new force which came into play, viz. that of gravity,
the effect of which I shall have to explain hereafter.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I cannot understand,” said Tom, “why the stone should not have fallen
out of the sling when you whirled it round over your head.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Because, my dear, it was acted upon by the
<span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'></span><i>centrifugal</i> force, which counteracted that of gravity: but I will
render this fact more evident, by a very simple and beautiful
experiment. I have here a wine-glass, around the rim of which I shall
attach a piece of string so as to enable me to whirl it round. I will
now fill it with water, and although during one part of its revolution
it will be actually inverted, you will find that I shall not spill a
single drop of water.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour then whirled round the glass, and the young party were
delighted with the confirmation thus afforded to their father’s
statement.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I see,” said Tom, “how it happened: when the glass was inverted the
water could not fall out, because it was influenced by the centrifugal
force which opposed gravity.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Exactly. Have you ever observed what happens during the trundling of
a mop? The threads which compose it fly off from the centre, but being
confined to it at one end they cannot part from it: while the water
which they contain being unconfined, is thrown off in right lines.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I have certainly observed what you state,” said Louisa; “the water
flies off in all directions from the mop.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Yes,” added Tom, “the water was not acted upon by the <i>centripetal</i>
force as the threads were, and consequently, there was nothing to
check the <i>centrifugal</i> force, which carried the water off in a
straight line from the centre.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You are not quite correct,” said Mr. Seymour; “the water does not fly
off in a right line from the centre, but in a right line in the
direction in which it was moving at the instant of its release; the
line which a body will always describe under such circumstances, is
called a <i>tangent</i>, because it <i>touches</i> the circumference of the
circle, and forms a right-angle with a line drawn from that point of
the circumference to the centre: but I will render this subject more
intelligible
<span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span>by a diagram.</p>

<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/figvii08.png' alt='Figure 8. Diagram for centrifugal force.' class='c040' />
</div>
<p class='c016'>“Suppose a body, revolving in the circle, was liberated at
<b><i>a</i></b>, it would fly off in the direction <i>ab</i>; if at <b><i>c</i></b>, in that of
<i>cd</i>; and if at <b><i>e</i></b>, in that of <i>ef</i>; and so on. Now, if you draw
lines from these several points to the centre of the circle, you will
perceive that such lines will form, in each case, a right-angle. In
the experiment which you have just witnessed, the surface of the water
must have formed, during its revolution, a right-angle with the
string, and consequently could not have fallen out of the wine-glass.
A knowledge of this law,” continued Mr. Seymour, “will explain many
appearances which, although familiar, I dare say, have never been
understood by you. You may remember accompanying me to the pottery, to
see the operation of the turning-lathe; it was owing to the
centrifugal force produced by the rotation of the wheel, that the
clay, under a gentle pressure, swelled out so regularly; from a
similar cause, the flour is thrown out of the revolving mill as fast
as it is ground; and I shall presently show you that you are indebted
to this same force for the spinning of your top and the trundling of
your hoop. But let us quit this subject for the present, and pursue
the stone in its course after it is liberated from the sling. Louisa
has justly observed that it described a curve; can you explain why it
should deviate from a straight line?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Let me see,” said Tom, thoughtfully; “it would be acted upon by two
forces, one carrying it forward in a right line, the other bringing it
to the earth; it would, therefore, not obey either, but describe a
diagonal: but why that diagonal should be a curve I cannot exactly
explain.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Then I will give you the reason,” said his father. “A stone projected
into the air is acted upon by no less
<span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span>than three forces; the force of projection, which is communicated to
it by the hand or the sling; the resistance of the air through which
it passes, and which diminishes its velocity without changing its
direction; and the force of gravity, which ultimately brings it to the
ground. Now, since the power of gravity and the resistance of the air
will always be greater than any force of projection we can give a
body, the latter must be gradually overcome, and the body brought to
the ground; but the stronger the projectile force, the longer will
those powers be in subduing it, and the farther will the body go
before it falls. A shot fired from a cannon, for instance, will go
much farther than a stone thrown from your hand. Had the two forces
which acted upon the stone, viz. those of projection and gravity, both
produced uniform motion, the body must certainly have descended
through the diagonal; but since gravity, as you have already learned,
is an accelerating force, the body is made to describe a curve instead
of a straight line.</p>

<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/figvii09.png' alt='Diagram 9. Diagram of a parabolic flight path.' class='c035' />
</div>
<p class='c016'>“This law, however, will require the aid of a
diagram for its explanation. Let <b><span class='fss'>X</span></b> represent the ball at its greatest
altitude, <b><span class='fss'>X Y</span></b> the force of gravity drawing it downward; and <b><span class='fss'>X Z</span></b> that
of projection. We have here, then, two forces acting in the direction
of the two sides of a parallelogram. In passing on to <b><span class='fss'>Z</span></b>, the ball will
perform the diagonal <b><span class='fss'>X</span></b> <b><i>a</i></b>; and in the next equal space of time, will
descend through <i>three</i> times the distance <b><span class='fss'>Z</span></b> <b><i>a</i></b>, and will
consequently be found at <b><i>b</i></b>; while in the next period it will fall
through <i>five</i> equal spaces, and pass to <b><i>c</i></b>; and in the next period,
again, as it must fall
<span class='pageno' title='130' id='Page_130'></span><i>seven</i> such spaces, it will reach the ground at <b><i>d</i></b>, having described
a portion of a curve from <b><span class='fss'>X</span></b> to <b><i>d</i></b>, or during the time that the two
forces were in simultaneous operation. The same principle will explain
the curved ascent of the ball, substituting only the laws of retarded
for those of accelerated motion; for it is clear, that the body during
its <i>ascent</i>, will be retarded in the same degree in which it was
accelerated during its <i>descent</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Your explanation,” said Louisa, “appears very clear and
satisfactory.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The curve which <i>Projectiles</i> (that is to say, bodies projected into
the air) describe, is termed a <i>Parabola</i> <a href='#note16'>(16)</a>, although the
resistance of the air, which is not recognised in the theory, produces
a considerable influence on the practical result.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The children now proceeded to amuse themselves with the sling. Louisa
challenged Tom to a trial of skill. She fancied that she could hurl a
stone with greater accuracy than her brother; but after several
contests she acknowledged herself vanquished, for Tom had succeeded in
striking the trunk of an old tree at a considerable distance, while
his sister was never able to throw the stone within several yards of
the mark.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well done, Tom!” exclaimed Mr. Seymour; “why you will soon equal in
skill the ancient natives of the Balearic Islands!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And were they famous for this art?” asked Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“With such dexterity,” replied her father, “did they use the sling,
that we are told their young children were not allowed any food by
their mothers, except that which they could fling down from the beam
where it was placed aloft. I fancy, however, Tom, that you would
become very hungry before you could strike an object in yonder
poplar.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“At all events, I will try,” said Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>He accordingly whirled round his sling, and discharged
<span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span>stone, which flew forward with great velocity, but in a direction very
wide from the mark at which it was aimed. In the next moment a violent
hallooing was heard: it was from the vicar, who had narrowly escaped
the boisterous salutation of the falling stone, which, in its anxiety
to throw itself at the feet of the reverend gentleman, struck the
beaver penthouse that defended his upper story, and by a resolution of
forces which we have endeavoured to explain, darted off in the
direction of the side of a parallelogram, and was thus averted from
the equally sensitive antipodes of his venerable person, the brains in
his head, and the corns in his shoes.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Upon my word, young gentleman!” cried the vicar, “I expected nothing
less than the fate of the giant of Gath.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“My dear Mr. Twaddleton,” exclaimed Tom, in a tone of alarm, “I
sincerely hope that you have not been struck?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“O no! thanks to my clerical helmet, I have escaped the danger which
threatened me: but, tell me, what new game is engaging your
attention?”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour said that he had been explaining the scientific principle
of the sling, and that he hoped the vicar was prepared to afford them
some information respecting its invention and history.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The sling?” repeated the vicar; “why, bless me! I left you
discoursing upon elasticity; you really stride over province after
province as rapidly as if you were gifted with the seven-leagued boots
of the Ogre:--but to the point in question. The art of slinging, or
casting stones, is one of the highest antiquity, and was carried to a
great degree of perfection amongst the Asiatic nations. It was well
known and practised at a very early period in Europe; and our Saxon
ancestors appear to have been very expert in the use of this missile.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Twaddleton, being desirous of communicating
<span class='pageno' title='132' id='Page_132'></span>history of Major Snapwell, begged that Mr. and Mrs. Seymour would
allow him a few minutes’ conversation; observing that the attention of
the children would be agreeably occupied during their absence by their
newly-acquired amusement.</p>

<p class='c016'>“We will then, if you please, vicar,” replied Mr. Seymour, “walk to
the Geological Temple, where I have lately deposited some specimens
which you have not yet seen.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“To speak sincerely,” said the vicar, “I cannot participate in that
high satisfaction which you appear to feel in collecting such hoards
of broken rocks and pebbles: where can lie the utility of such labour?
unless, indeed, in pursuance of your Utopian plans, you intend to
<i>Mac-adamise</i> all the roads of science.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Is it nothing, my dear Mr. Twaddleton, to discover the structure of
different countries?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Which the geologist infers,” replied the vicar, “from a few
<i>patterns</i>, picked up at random on the road side!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Mr. Twaddleton,” said Mr. Seymour, “I will meet you on your own
ground: you are an antiquary; if an ancient monument of art be so
inestimable, is not a knowledge of the antiquity of the globe itself,
at least, of equal interest?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I understand you: you would infer that the scriptural account of the
Deluge is disproved by those Sciolists, who pretend to discover the
antiquity of the globe by penetrating its caverns, with as much ease
as the jockey ascertains the age of a horse by looking into its jaws.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You speak too flippantly of a class of philosophers who have united
their efforts to investigate a sublime subject upon the true
principles of science; were you to attend the meetings of the
Geological Society, and hear the discussions of its members, you would
cease to talk thus irreverently.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Although I may be unknown to your genii of the
<span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'></span>mountains, I am, at all events, acquainted with a kindred class of
philosophers who rival them in industry, if not in talents; and
notwithstanding the limited range of their observations--being
confined to the mountainous districts they inhabit--I have little
doubt but that their labours have proved as acceptable to the world as
those of the disciples of Hutton or Werner. I once visited this
district, and although the language of its inhabitants was entirely
unknown to me, I soon discovered, by the aid of a glass, that they
were in serious discourse with each other; and one of the elders of
the fraternity, who was seated on a craggy precipice that overhung an
extensive valley covered with rich verdure, appeared, from his
gestures, as if pointing out to his fellow-labourers, who were digging
in all directions in search of treasure, the danger of an approaching
convulsion. While I was yet gazing, the fatal catastrophe actually
occurred; immense masses of the tottering strata rolled with
precipitous haste into the valley, involving in its ruin hundreds of
its inhabitants. It was extraordinary to behold the effects of this
shock upon those who were beyond the reach of its more destructive
influence; hundreds were seen scaling heights that appeared
inaccessible; others, stumbling--falling down frightful
precipices--rising again--helping, or pushing each other on--the
foremost serving as so many stepping-stones to those behind, who, in
their turn, hauled up the clusters over whose backs they had so
unceremoniously vaulted.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“How awful!” cried Mrs. Seymour; “I never heard of any modern
catastrophe of such fearful extent: where did it occur?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The vicar doubtless alludes to the terrible earthquake of Messina, or
perhaps to that of Lisbon.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I neither allude to the one nor to the other,” cried Mr. Twaddleton;
“and yet, in some respects, the catastrophe which I have described
resembled that of Lisbon; for during the dreadful disaster human
beings
<span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span>seen to take advantage of the confusion to murder many of the
inhabitants, and to pillage their territories.”<a href='#note17'>(17)</a></p>

<p class='c016'>“For goodness’ sake!” cried Mrs. Seymour, “tell us at once where this
terrible event occurred.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“In a fine Cheshire cheese!” exclaimed the vicar, “which had furnished
abundant food to the miniature republic of mites that occupied its
deep ravines and alpine heights. I think now,” continued the reverend
gentleman, “I am amply revenged for the allegorical jokes in which Mr.
Seymour has so often indulged at my expense.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I am well satisfied,” said Mr. Seymour; “for by repeating your
allegory to my children, I shall be enabled to convey a striking
lesson of wisdom. They will learn from it that there is not any
pursuit, however exalted, that may not be assailed by the weapons of
ridicule, especially when wielded by those penurious philosophers
whose ideas of utility are circumscribed within the narrow limits of
direct and immediate profit.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is too true,” cried Mrs. Seymour, “that we are all apt to
depreciate those branches of knowledge which do not bear directly upon
the comforts or necessities of life; and the applications of geology
are, perhaps, so remote as scarcely to be discovered by the mass of
mankind.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“There I must differ with you,” replied her husband: “to say nothing
of the practical advantages which have accrued to the miner from this
study, it has been the means of bringing hundreds of acres into
cultivation in districts where never a blade of grass had before
grown;<a href='#note18'>(18)</a> and if scholastic researches have thrown additional light
on scriptural subjects, they are no more to be compared with those of
the geologist on these occasions, than is the light of the glow-worm
to that of the sun.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Hey-day! what do I hear?” exclaimed the vicar.
<span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'></span>“Would you compare the testimony of the Apamean medal with that of an
unshapen flint?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I would rest my faith upon a <i>rock</i>,” replied Mr. Seymour; “the caves
of Buckland<a href='#note19'>(19)</a> have done more towards supporting the Mosaic account
of the Deluge than all the medals of the virtuoso. Fossils, in truth,
are to the geologist what medals are to the antiquary, preserving a
record of events which must otherwise have perished in the stream of
time.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. and Mrs. Seymour and the vicar by this time arrived at the
Wernerian Temple, where, having discussed several points connected
with its objects, Mr. Twaddleton gave an account of Major Snapwell,
whose history created considerable interest, and determined Mr.
Seymour to call at Ivy Cottage, and invite its inmate to the Lodge.</p>

<p class='c024'>“Tom, do you remember that I told you a few days ago,” said Mr.
Seymour, “that, by giving a revolving body a peculiar <i>spinning</i>
motion, certain effects were produced, which I should, on some future
occasion, take into consideration?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“To be sure I do,” replied Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well, then, attend to me.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour took a marble, and, placing it on the
<span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'></span>ground, gave it an impulse forward by pressing his forefinger upon it:
the marble darted forward a few paces, after which it rolled back
again.</p>

<p class='c016'>“That is most extraordinary!” cried Tom; “the marble came back to your
hand, as it were, of its own accord, and without having met with any
obstacle.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And you, no doubt,” said Mr. Seymour, “regard it as contrary to the
well known law, that a body once put in motion, in any direction, will
continue to move in that direction until some foreign cause oppose
it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It really would appear so.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is, however, far otherwise; the force which I imparted to the
marble communicated to it two kinds of motion; the one projecting it
forward, the other producing a rotatory motion round its axis, in a
direction opposite to that of its rectilinear course; and the
consequence was simply this, that when the former motion, on account
of the friction of the marble on the ground, was destroyed, the
rotatory motion continued, and by thus establishing an action in an
opposite direction, caused the marble to retrograde. If, however, you
will fetch your hoop, I will demonstrate the fact on a larger scale.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Tom accordingly produced the hoop; and Mr. Seymour projected it
forward, giving to it, at the same instant, a spinning motion in an
opposite direction. The hoop proceeded forward to a certain distance,
when it stopped, and then ran back to the hand.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Let me beg you,” said Mr. Seymour, “to treasure this fact in your
memory; you perceive by it how greatly the progressive direction of a
body may be influenced by a rotatory motion around its axis; and,
indeed, the theory of the <i>rifle</i> gun<a href='#note20'>(20)</a> is easily deduced from it.
It will also explain the effect which a rotatory motion produces in
steadying or disturbing the direction of a projectile. It is for such
a reason that the balancer constantly whirls round his balls or
oranges, as he throws them into the air, with the intention
<span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'></span>of catching them again; and that in playing at <i>Bilboquet</i>, or cup and
ball, you find it necessary to give a spinning motion to the ball, in
order to catch it on the spike--but we will consider this subject
presently. I am now desirous of laying down a few propositions upon
the subject of rotation, the knowledge of which is essential for the
explanation of the motions of revolving bodies.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour proceeded to state that every body had three principal
axes upon which it might revolve, but that the shortest was the only
one upon which it could permanently and steadily rotate--that should
it, in consequence of the impulse given to it, begin to spin upon any
other than the shortest axis, it would, during its revolutions, be
constantly showing a tendency to approach it; whence it followed that,
under such circumstances, it would be unsteady and <i>wabbling</i> in its
motions.</p>

<p class='c016'>In order, however, to make this proposition intelligible to the
children, Mr. Seymour performed the following simple experiment.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id014'>
<img src='images/figp155.png' alt='Two rings, labeled 1 and 2.' class='ig014' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>Having tied some string to a common curtain ring, as represented by
figure 1, he twisted it round by means of his thumb and finger, until
it acquired considerable velocity, when the ring was seen to rise
gradually into the position represented by fig. 2. Thus,
<span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span>in the simplest manner, was a revolving body shown to exchange its longer
for its shorter axis.</p>

<p class='c016'>The children declared that they perfectly comprehended the subject,
and Tom observed that, in future, whenever he wished to make a ball
spin steadily, he should take care to make it turn on its shortest
axis.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You are quite right, Tom,” said Mr. Seymour; “and the skilful bowler
at cricket, in order to give his ball a steady axis of rotation,
always holds it with the seam across, so that the tips of his fingers
may touch, and he takes care to hold it only with such a grasp as may
be sufficient to steady it, for by a turn even of the wrist it may be
made to proceed unsteadily; and this leads me to consider another
equally important proposition--viz. that the axis of rotation should
coincide with the direction in which it is moving forward, or, in
other words, with its line of motion. Now, where this is not the case,
it is evident that the unequal action of the air will cause the body
to deviate from its straight course, since its two sides, having
different velocities (the rotatory and progressive motions conspiring
on one side, while they are in opposition on the other), will be
differently affected by such resistance; the resistance, of course,
increasing with the velocity. It is upon this principle,” continued
Mr. Seymour, “that Sir Isaac Newton has explained the irregular motion
of the tennis-ball.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“But do explain to us, papa,” said Louisa, “why it is so necessary to
spin the ball in order to catch it on the spike?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Rotatory motion, my dear, when directed according to the principles I
have endeavoured to enforce, will always steady the course of a body.
In playing at bilboquet, your object is so to throw up the ball that
its hole may descend perpendicularly upon the spike which is held for
its reception; and in order to accomplish this, you make the ball spin
upon an axis,
<span class='pageno' title='140' id='Page_140'></span>at the extremity of which is the hole; the consequence is obvious.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Louisa observed, that she well remembered an allusion to this game in
Miss Edgeworth’s Essays on Education; and that, unless she was much
deceived, the advantage to be gained by spinning the ball was referred
to centrifugal force, and its effect in preserving the “<i>parallelism
of motion</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I do not recollect the passage,” answered her father, “but I will
admit that the centrifugal force is indirectly instrumental to the
effect, although, in my view of the subject, it is more philosophical
to refer it at once to the creation of an appropriate axis of
rotation.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I well remember,” observed Tom, “that the rider at Astley’s whirled
round the oranges as he threw them into the air.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And I hope that you are now not only acquainted with the principle
which rendered such a rotatory motion necessary, but that which must
make the shorter the more eligible axis for effecting his
purpose;--but can you tell me how it could have happened, that the
oranges, which were thrown perpendicularly upwards while the horseman
was on the full gallop, should have fallen again into his hand?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Ay,” said Louisa, “that puzzled me exceedingly; I should have thought
he would have ridden away from them, and that they must have fallen
several feet behind him.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“What say you, Tom, to that?” enquired Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I suppose,” replied Tom, “that the rider calculated upon the distance
he would pass forward before they could fall, and projected them
accordingly.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“No, indeed; there is no calculation in the case, nor is any art used
to throw the oranges in advance: they are projected perpendicularly
from the hand; and if you will only recall to your mind the subject
<span class='pageno' title='141' id='Page_141'></span>of the ‘Composition of Forces,’ the mystery will vanish.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I see it all clearly,” cried Tom; “the orange partakes of the
progressive motion of the rider; when, therefore, he throws it
upwards, it is influenced by two forces which are in the direction of
the two sides of a parallelogram, and it consequently describes the
diagonal.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You are quite right; but you doubtless will perceive that, instead of
a straight line, the orange will describe a parabolic curve.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“For the same reason, I suppose,” said Tom, “that the stone from the
sling described a curve?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Certainly; but see, I have a diagram which will explain the subject
more clearly.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id015'>
<img src='images/figp158.png' alt='A man on a moving horse demonstrates progressive motion with an orange.' class='ig015' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>“The orange, as it is thrown into the air, is influenced by two
forces: the one arising from the progressive motion of the rider, the
other from the projectile force imparted to it. These two forces are
in the direction of the adjacent sides of a parallelogram, and were it
not for the operation of gravity, the body
<span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span>would accordingly describe its diagonal in the same space of time as
it would have described one of the sides.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c017'><sup>[18]</sup></a> The influence of
gravity, however, not only deflects it from a right line into a curve,
but diminishes its force, so that instead of arriving at the opposite
angle of the parallelogram <b><i>a</i></b>, its greatest altitude will be short of
that point; it will then descend through a similar curve; and, since
the times of ascent and descent are equal,<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c017'><sup>[19]</sup></a> it will reach the hand
of the rider at the very moment he is prepared to receive it; for the
orange will have traversed the parabolic curve in the same space of
time as the horseman required for passing from one extremity of the
curve to the other.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour having concluded this explanation, much to the
satisfaction of the young party, observed that the present occasion
was an appropriate one for the introduction of some remarks on the
favourite pastime of the <span class='sc'>Hoop</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is a classical pastime,” exclaimed the vicar, “and was as common
with the Greeks and Romans as it is with boys of the present
generation.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And it has the advantage,” added Mr. Seymour, “of sending the tide of
life in healthful currents through the veins.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Tom began to trundle his hoop along the gravel walk.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Stop, stop, my dear boy,” cried his father, “you seem to have
forgotten our compact, that every toy should be fairly won before it
was played with. Come upon the lawn, and let me ask you some questions
relative to the motions of the hoop. Can you make it stand still upon
its edge?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Not readily,” was Tom’s reply.</p>

<p class='c016'>“And yet,” continued Mr. Seymour, “during its progressive motion, it
rolls on its edge without any disposition to fall: how happens that?”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='143' id='Page_143'></span>“It is owing to the centrifugal force, which gives it a motion in the
direction of a <i>tangent</i> to the circle, and, consequently, overcomes
the force of gravity.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Your answer is pat,” replied his father: “as long as you give your
hoop a certain degree of velocity, the <i>tangential</i>, or centrifugal
force, overcomes gravity, in the manner you have already
witnessed;<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c017'><sup>[20]</sup></a> but, when that is slackened, the hoop will fall on its
side; not, however, until it has made several complete revolutions.
Now, answer me another question. Why is it so difficult to make the
hoop proceed straight forward, without turning to the right or left?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I suppose it arises from the same cause as that which altered the
direction of my marble as it ran along--the inequality of the ground.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“That,” replied his father, “would undoubtedly have its influence; but
it is principally to be referred to the impossibility of your
constantly giving a straight blow by the stick. When it is moving
forward, a slight inclination towards either side will cause the parts
to acquire a motion towards that side, those which are uppermost being
most affected by it; and this lateral, or sideway motion, assisted
sometimes by the irregular curvature of the hoop, causes its path to
deviate from a rectilinear direction; so that, instead of moving
straight forward, it turns to that side towards which it began to
incline; and, in this position, its tendency to fall is still farther
counteracted by the centrifugal force. It is from a similar cause that
the bullet, unless rifled, will have a tendency to go to the right or
left, from any unequal impulse which it may have received at the
moment of its exit from the barrel. I have yet one other question,
and, as its answer will lead us into the consideration of a mechanical
subject of some importance, I must beg you to bestow all your
attention. In trundling your hoop, have you not often
<span class='pageno' title='144' id='Page_144'></span>observed that, although the blow inflicted upon it by your stick might have
been violent, yet the effect produced by it was comparatively small,
in consequence of the hoop having been struck by a disadvantageous
part of the stick?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Certainly! I have frequently observed that, if the hoop is struck by
the stick either too near the hand, or too near the end, much of its
force is lost; and I have also noticed the same thing in striking the
ball with my cricket-bat.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The fact is,” said Mr. Seymour, “that every striking body has what is
termed its <i>centre of percussion</i>, in which all the percutient force
of a body is, as it were, collected; thus, a stick of a cylindrical
figure, supposing the centre of motion at the hand, will strike the
greatest blow at a point about two-thirds of its length from the
wrist. I may, perhaps, at some future time, return to this subject,
and explain several mechanical effects which are dependent upon
it.<a href='#note21'>(21)</a> Now away with you, and trundle your hoop, or spin your top; as
soon as the vicar arrives I will rejoin you.”</p>

<p class='c016'>In the course of an hour Mr. Seymour and his reverend friend proceeded
to the play-ground, where they found the children busily engaged in
their several diversions.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I rejoice to find you at so classical a pastime,” said the vicar, as
he approached Tom, who was busily engaged in spinning his top. “The
top, my boy, is a subject which the great Mantuan bard did not
consider beneath the patronage of his muse: but, hey-day! this is not
the ‘<i>volitans sub verbere turbo</i>’ of the immortal Virgil; the top of
antiquity was the whip-top, the peg-top is a barbarous innovation of
modern times: a practical proof of the degeneracy of the race. Even
boys, forsooth, must now-a-days have their activity cramped by
inventions to supersede labour: well may we regard the weapons, which
our sturdy ancestors
<span class='pageno' title='145' id='Page_145'></span>wielded as instruments rather calculated for giants than men, if such pains be
taken to instil into the minds of youth the mischievous spirit of
idleness.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“My dear sir,” said Tom, who was always grieved at displeasing the
vicar, “if it will gratify you, I will spin my <i>whip</i>-top, for I have
an excellent one which my papa has lately given me.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well said! my dear boy. ‘<i>Puer bonæ spei.</i>’--What a pity would it be
to damp so noble a spirit; get your whip-top.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Tom accordingly placed the Virgilian top upon the ground, and as the
boy plied the whip, so did the vicar lash the air with his quotation;
running round the top in apparent ecstasy, while he repeated the
well-known lines from the seventh Æneid:--</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c043'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in10'><b>“Ille actus habena</b></div>
      <div class='line'><b>Curvatis fertur spatiis; stupet inscia turba,</b></div>
      <div class='line'><b>Impubesque manus, mirata volubile buxum:</b></div>
      <div class='line'><b>Dant animos plagæ.”</b><a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c017'><sup>[21]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c044'>As Mr. Twaddleton thus gave vent to that fervour which was ever
kindled by collision with Virgil, Tom gave motion to his top, which
swaggered about with such an air of self-importance, that, to the eye
of fancy, it might have appeared as if proudly conscious of the
encomiums that had been so liberally lavished upon it.</p>

<p class='c044'>“The Grecian boys, as Suidas informs us, played also with this top,”
continued the vicar.</p>

<p class='c044'>“And pray, may I ask,” said Mr. Seymour, “whether it was not
introduced into this country by the Romans?”</p>

<p class='c044'>“Probably,” replied the vicar. “Figures representing boys in the act
of whipping their tops first appear in the marginal paintings of the
manuscripts of
<span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'></span>the fourteenth century; at which period, the form of the toy was the same
as it is at present, and the manner of impelling it by the whip can
admit of but little if any difference. In a manuscript,<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c017'><sup>[22]</sup></a> at the
British Museum, I have read a very curious anecdote which refers to
Prince Henry, the eldest son of James the First; with your permission
I will relate it to you.”</p>

<p class='c044'>Here the vicar extracted a memorandum-book from his pocket, and read
the following note:--</p>

<p class='c044'>“The first tyme that he, the prince, went to the towne of Sterling to
meete the king, seeing a little without the gate of the towne a stack
of corne, in proportion not unlike to a topp, wherewith he used to
play, he said to some that were with him, ‘Loe there is a goodly
topp:’ whereupon one of them saying, ‘Why doe you not play with it
then?’ he answered, ‘Set you it up for me, and I will play with it.’”</p>

<p class='c044'>“Was not that a clever retort of the young prince?” said the vicar, as
he returned the manuscript into his memorandum-book; “and I think it
must have confounded the courtier who could have asked so silly a
question.”</p>

<p class='c044'>“Well, Tom,” said Mr. Seymour, “let us see whether you can set up your
own top, so that it shall stand steadily on its point.”</p>

<p class='c044'>“I have often tried that experiment,” answered Tom, “but could never
succeed in keeping the line of direction within its narrow base.”</p>

<p class='c044'>“And yet, when in rotatory motion, its erect position is maintained
without difficulty; how is that?”</p>

<p class='c044'>“Is it not owing to the centrifugal force?” asked Tom.</p>

<p class='c044'>“Undoubtedly: but as the subject is highly interesting, I will
endeavour to explain it more fully. You must, however, first obtain
permission from the vicar to spin your humming-top, for that will
better illustrate the phenomena which it is my wish to examine.”</p>

<p class='c044'>“If your object is the exercise of the body, let us
<span class='pageno' title='147' id='Page_147'></span>spin the whip-top,” replied the vicar; “but if you wish to exercise the
boy’s mind, I cannot object to your selecting the top best calculated
to fulfil that desire.”</p>

<p class='c044'>Tom, having accordingly prepared his top, pulled the string, and set
the wooden machine spinning on the floor.</p>

<p class='c044'>“Now, Tom, I will explain to you the reason of the top being able to
sustain its vertical position. You have already learned, from the
action of the sling, that a body cannot move in a circular path,
without making an effort to fly off in a right line from the
centre;<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c017'><sup>[23]</sup></a> so that, if a body be affixed to a string, and whirled
round by the hand, it will stretch it, and in a greater degree
according as the circular motion is more rapid.”</p>

<p class='c044'>“Certainly,” said Tom.</p>

<p class='c044'>“The top, then, being in motion, all its parts tend to recede from the
axis, and with greater force the more rapidly it revolves: hence it
follows that these parts are like so many powers acting in a direction
perpendicular to the axis; but, as they are all equal, and as they
pass all round with rapidity by the rotation, the result must be that
the top is in equilibrio on its point of support, or on the extremity
of the axis on which it turns. But see, your top is down.”</p>

<p class='c044'>“And what is the reason,” asked Tom, “of its motion being stopped?”</p>

<p class='c044'>“I can answer that question, papa,” said Louisa; “is it not owing to
the friction of the ground?”</p>

<p class='c044'>“Certainly; that has, doubtless, its influence: but the resistance of
the air is also a powerful force upon this occasion. A top has been
made to spin in vacuo as long as two hours and sixteen minutes.<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c017'><sup>[24]</sup></a>
But come, Tom, spin your top once more. Observe,” exclaimed Mr.
Seymour, “how obliquely the top is spinning. It is now gradually
rising out of an oblique
<span class='pageno' title='148' id='Page_148'></span>position;--now it is steadily spinning on a vertical axis;--and now
its motion is so steady, that it scarcely seems to move.”</p>

<p class='c044'>“It is <i>sleeping</i>, as we call it,” said Tom.</p>

<p class='c044'>“Its centre of gravity is now situated perpendicularly over its point
of support, which is the extremity of the axis of rotation: but attend
to me,” continued Mr. Seymour, “for I am about to attempt the
explanation of a phenomenon which has puzzled many older and wiser
philosophers than yourselves. It is evident that the top, in rising
from an oblique to a vertical position, must have its centre of
gravity raised; what can have been the force which effected this
change?”</p>

<p class='c044'>“Was it the centrifugal force?” asked Tom.</p>

<p class='c044'>“Certainly not,” said Mr. Seymour, “as I will presently convince you.”</p>

<p class='c044'>“Then it must have been the resistance of the air,” said Louisa.</p>

<p class='c044'>“No; nor was it the resistance of the air,” replied her father: “for
the same effect takes place in vacuo.”</p>

<p class='c044'>“Then pray inform us, by what means the top was raised.”</p>

<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/figp165.png' alt='A toy top, diagonal to a surface.' class='c040' />
</div>

<p class='c044'>“It entirely depended upon the form of the extremity of the peg, and
not upon any simple effect connected with the rotatory or centrifugal
force of the top. I will first satisfy you that, were the peg to
terminate in a fine, that is to say, in a <i>mathematical</i> point, the
top never could raise itself. Let <b><span class='fss'>A B C</span></b> be a top spinning in an
oblique position, having the end of the peg, on which it spins,
brought to a fine point. It will continue to spin in the direction in
which it reaches the ground, without the least tendency to rise into a
more vertical position;
<span class='pageno' title='149' id='Page_149'></span>and it is by its rotatory or centrifugal force that it is kept in this
original position: for if we conceive the top divided into two equal
parts <b><span class='fss'>A</span></b> and <b><span class='fss'>B</span></b>, by a plane passing through the line <b><span class='fss'>X C</span></b>, and suppose
that at any moment during its spinning, the connection between these
two parts were suddenly dissolved, then would any point in the part <b><span class='fss'>A</span></b>
fly off with the given force in the direction of the tangent, and any
corresponding point in the part <b><span class='fss'>B</span></b> with an equal force in an opposite
direction; whilst, therefore, these two parts remain connected
together, during the spinning of the top, these two equal and opposite
forces <b><span class='fss'>A</span></b> and <b><span class='fss'>B</span></b> will balance each other, and the top will continue to
spin on its original axis. Having thus shown that the rotatory or
centrifugal force can never make the top rise from an oblique to a
vertical position, I shall proceed to explain the true cause of this
change, and I trust you will be satisfied that it depends upon the
bluntness of the point.</p>
<div class='figleft'>
<img src='images/figp166.png' alt='Oblique toy top' class='c036' />
</div>
<p class='c044'>Let <b><span class='fss'>A B C</span></b> be a top spinning in an oblique
position, terminating in a very short point with a hemispherical
shoulder <b><span class='fss'>P</span></b> <b><i>a</i></b> <b><span class='fss'>M</span></b>. It is evident that, in this case, the top will not
spin upon <b><i>a</i></b> the end of the true axis <b><span class='fss'>X</span></b> <b><i>a</i></b>, but upon <b><span class='fss'>P</span></b>, a point in
the circle <b><span class='fss'>P M</span></b>, to which the floor <b><span class='fss'>I F</span></b> is a tangent. Instead,
therefore, of revolving upon a fixed and stationary point, the top
will roll round upon the small circle <b><span class='fss'>P M</span></b> on its blunt point, with
very considerable friction, the force of which may be represented by a
line <b><span class='fss'>O P</span></b> at right angles to the floor <b><span class='fss'>I F</span></b>, and to the spherical end of
the peg of the top: now it is the action of this force, by its
pressure on one side of the blunt point of the top, which causes it to
rise in a
<span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span>vertical direction. Produce the line <b><span class='fss'>O P</span></b> till it meets the axis <b><span class='fss'>C</span></b>; from the
point <b><span class='fss'>C</span></b> draw the line <b><span class='fss'>C t</span></b> perpendicular to the axis <b><i>a</i></b> <b><span class='fss'>X</span></b>, and <b><span class='fss'>T O</span></b>
parallel to it; and then, by a resolution of forces, the line <b><span class='fss'>T C</span></b> will
represent that part of the friction which presses at right angles to
the axis, so as gradually to raise it in a vertical position; in which
operation the circle <b><span class='fss'>P M</span></b> gradually diminishes by the approach of the
point <b><span class='fss'>P</span></b> to <b><i>a</i></b>, as the axis becomes more perpendicular, and vanishes
when the point <b><span class='fss'>P</span></b> coincides with the point <b><i>a</i></b>, that is to say, when
the top has arrived at its vertical position, where it will continue
to <i>sleep</i>, without much friction, or any other disturbing force,
until its rotatory motion fails, and its side is brought to the earth
by the force of gravity.”</p>

<p class='c044'>“I <i>think</i> I understand it,” said Tom, “although I have some doubt
about it; but if you would be so kind as to give me the demonstration
in writing, I will diligently study it.”</p>

<p class='c044'>“Most readily,” said Mr. Seymour. “Indeed I cannot expect that you
should comprehend so difficult a subject, without the most patient
investigation; and, in the present state of your knowledge, I am
compelled to omit the relation of several very important
circumstances, to which I may, hereafter, direct your attention. When,
for instance, you have become acquainted with the elements of
astronomy, I shall be able to show you that the gyration of the top
depends upon the same principles as the precession of the
equinoxes.”<a href='#note22'>(22)</a></p>

the Ball.--The See-saw.--The Mechanical Powers.--The Swing.--The
Doctrine of Oscillation.--Galileo’s Discovery.--The Pendulum.--An

Snapwell.</i></p>

<p class='c024'>Mr. Seymour, having observed his children busily engaged at the game
of Trap and Ball, determined, as usual, to make it subservient to
scientific instruction.
<span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'></span>With this view he hastily sketched a diagram, and proceeded with it to the
scene of sport.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Now, Tom, let me see how far you have profited by our late
conversation. I have some questions to ask you about the action of
your Trap and Ball,” said his father.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I do not suppose there is much philosophy in the game,” observed Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Of that we shall judge presently.--Can you tell me the direction
which the ball takes after it flies from the spoon of the Trap, in
consequence of the blow of the bat upon the trigger?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It flies upwards, to be sure, and allows me to strike it with my
bat,” answered the boy.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Very true; but at what angle?--I see you hesitate, look therefore at
the diagram I have prepared, and attend to my explanation of it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour produced the sketch which we here present to our readers.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id018'>
<img src='images/figp169.png' alt='Sketch of Trap.' class='ig018' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>“<b><span class='fss'>A B</span></b> represent the spoon and trigger in their quiescent position. Upon
striking the end <b><span class='fss'>B</span></b> with the bat, they are brought into the position <b><span class='fss'>C D</span></b>.
The spoon will thus have described the small arc <b><span class='fss'>A C</span></b>, when it will
be suddenly stopped by the end of the trigger <b><span class='fss'>D</span></b> coming into contact
with the shoe. The motion of the
<span class='pageno' title='153' id='Page_153'></span>ball, however, will not be arrested, and it will consequently be projected
forward out of the spoon.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Exactly,” exclaimed Louisa, “in the same manner as the shilling flew
off the wine glass, or a person on a galloping horse would be thrown
over the head by its suddenly stopping.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I thank you, Louisa; your memory, I perceive, has not suffered from
the drenching you received from the water-cart;<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c017'><sup>[25]</sup></a>--but can you tell
me,” continued Mr. Seymour, “the direction which the ball will take
<i>after</i> its release from the spoon?”</p>

<p class='c016'>This was a step beyond Louisa’s knowledge, and her father, in order to
assist her, begged her to consider in what direction it was moving
<i>before</i> it left the spoon.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You have just told us,” said Tom, “that it described an arc, or
portion of a circle.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Very well,” said Mr. Seymour; “and did not the philosophy of your
sling teach you that, when a body revolving in a circle is suddenly
disengaged, it will fly off in a right line in the direction in which
it was moving at the instant of its release?--the ball therefore will
describe the tangent <b><span class='fss'>C E</span></b>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is all clear enough to me now,” said Tom, evidently vexed that he
had overlooked a principle which had been so lately explained to him
by the action of his sling.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I now see, too,” added Tom, “why the ball seldom flies off at the
same angle in every trap.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“That,” said his father, “must of course depend upon the extent of the
arc described by the spoon, and which will of course vary in different
traps.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Before we conclude the subject, let me ask you whether there is not
some one point in the bat, at which you can most effectually strike
the ball?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“To be sure,” answered Tom, “in the same way
<span class='pageno' title='154' id='Page_154'></span>tha there is a point in my hoop-stick at which I can give the strongest
blow--and that point is termed the <i>Centre</i> of Percussion.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Enough,” said Mr. Seymour; “see, here comes the vicar.”</p>

<p class='c016'>True to the hour appointed, did Mr. Twaddleton make his appearance,
just at the conclusion of the discussion above described; and, as he
approached the party, Louisa observed that he was carrying a canvass
bag in his hand.</p>

<p class='c016'>“What have you there?” asked Mr. Seymour. “A sack of sugar-plums?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“No, no; spheres of larger diameter. Here,” said the vicar, as he
opened his bag, “is a foot-ball for you, Tom; and here is a hand-ball
for you, Louisa.” He then presented each of the other children with a
similar present, exclaiming--</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c026'>
    <div><b>‘Nemo ex hoc numero mihi non donatus abibit.’</b><a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c017'><sup>[26]</sup></a></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c029'>as Virgil has it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Perhaps,” said Mr. Seymour, “you will enhance the value of this
favour, by giving us an antiquarian history of the ball, which will be
very acceptable to us at this time, as we have just concluded a
philosophical enquiry upon that subject.”</p>

<p class='c016'>To this request the vicar readily assented, and proceeded as
follows:--</p>

<p class='c016'>“The Greeks appear to have played with four kinds of ball: viz. the
<i>little ball</i>, the <i>great ball</i>, the <i>empty ball</i> (
σφαιρα κενη
), which was blown up with air, like our foot-ball, and the
<i>leathern ball</i> (
κωρυκον
), which was suspended from the
ceiling, and stuffed with bran or sand, as those who tossed it were
robust or delicate. The Romans,” continued the vicar, “had also four
kinds of <i>pilæ</i>, or balls. The <i>follis</i>, a large ball made
<span class='pageno' title='155' id='Page_155'></span>of leather and blown up with air, like our foot-ball; the larger kinds of
which were struck with the arm, the smaller ones with the fist.
Suetonius tells us that Augustus Cæsar greatly delighted in the
amusement; and in truth it was a glorious sport, an exercise equally
adapted for the young and old; or as Martial has it,--</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c026'>
    <div><b>‘<i>Folle</i> decet pueros ludere, <i>folle</i> senes.’</b>“<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c017'><sup>[27]</sup></a></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c025'>“And yet,” said Mr. Seymour, “neither Horace nor Virgil played at it;

<p class='c016'>“Many thanks, Mr. Seymour, many thanks for brushing up my
recollection; but I am a little doubtful about the game at which
Mæcenas played at Capua: I have, by-the-by, lately read<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c017'><sup>[29]</sup></a> an account
of a peculiar game of ball for which the city of Sierra is celebrated,
and it is supposed to be that referred to by Horace--‘It is played in
the foss, which has a very high wall, and it is not unlike a
tennis-court; the ball is very large, and appears to be inflated with
air; the arm is defended by a wooden guard or shield; at certain
periods of the game, one of the players runs down a spring-board, and
throwing the whole of his weight, momentum, and strength upon the
ball, as it is thrown towards him, he strikes it to an astonishing
distance.’ The second kind of ball,” continued the vicar, “was termed
<i>trigonalis</i>, which is conjectured to have been nearly the same as our
tennis-ball. It derived its name from the position of the three
persons who
<span class='pageno' title='156' id='Page_156'></span>played with it; they were placed in a triangle, and alternately caught
and tossed the ball, and he who first let it fall to the ground was
the loser. The third kind of ball was the <i>paganica</i>, as being much
used in country villages. Some authors state it to have been
constructed of leather and stuffed with feathers, while others
conjecture it to have been a large kind of <i>follis</i>. The fourth was
the <i>harpastum</i>; a small ball, so called because the gamesters
endeavoured to snatch it from each other.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It seems,” observed Louisa, “to be a sport better adapted to boys
than girls.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“In that supposition you are quite mistaken,” replied the vicar; “on
the contrary, the hand-ball would seem to have been originally a
female sport, for Homer has restricted the pastime to the princess and
young maidens of Corcyra; at least, he has not mentioned its ever
having been practised by the men.</p>

</div>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour said that, as the vicar had satisfied them of the high
antiquity of the ball, he hoped he would now afford them some
information respecting its use in England.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The game of hand-ball,” said the vicar, “called by the French
<i>palm-play</i>, because the exercise consisted originally in receiving
the ball, and driving it back again with the <i>palm of the hand</i>, was
formerly a favourite pastime among the youth of both sexes; and in
many parts of the kingdom it was customary for them to play at this
game during the Easter holidays for tansy cakes. In ancient times, the
mayor and aldermen of Newcastle used to go in state at the feasts of
Easter and Whitsuntide, to a little mall of the town, to witness this
game. It was originally played with
<span class='pageno' title='157' id='Page_157'></span>the naked hand; then with a glove, which in some instances was lined;
afterwards, cords and catgut strings were bound upon the hand to make
the ball rebound more forcibly.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“That custom,” observed Mr. Seymour, “doubtless, gave origin to the
<i>racket</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It did,” replied the vicar; “and the places where this game was
played were called <i>tennis-courts</i>, and the game itself obtained the
name of <i>tennis</i>, from the French word <i>tenez</i><a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c017'><sup>[31]</sup></a> (take it, hold it),
frequently used during the exercise. The pastime, I believe, was
introduced amongst our ancestors about the year 1222, the sixth year
of Henry III, by persons of superior rank and family, who erected
courts or oblong edifices for the performance of the exercise.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I long to hear something about foot-ball,” exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“That is a pastime,” said the vicar, “which was formerly in great
vogue in England, but of late years it has fallen into disrepute. It
derives its name, as you may suppose, from the circumstance of the
ball being driven with the foot, in preference to the hand. When a
match is made, two parties, equal in numbers, take the field, and
stand between two goals, which are placed at the distance of eighty or
a hundred yards from each other. The ball, which is commonly a blown
bladder, cased with leather, is delivered in the midst of the ground,
and the object of either party is to drive it through the goal of
their opponents, by which the game is won. The abilities of the
performers are best displayed in attacking and defending
<span class='pageno' title='158' id='Page_158'></span>the goals, whence the pastime is more frequently called a <i>goal</i>, than a
<i>game</i> at foot-ball. In this attack and defence, the exercise becomes
exceedingly violent; the players kick each other’s shins without the
least ceremony; and this occasioned James I. to speak of foot-ball as
‘<i>meeter for laming than making able the users thereof</i>.’”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I believe,” said Mr. Seymour, “that the ancient game of <i>goff</i> is
still much practised in Scotland.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is,” replied the vicar. “In the reign of Edward III. the Latin
name <i>cambuca</i>, a crooked club, or staff, was applied to this pastime,
because it was played with such an instrument. The bat was also styled
a <i>bandy</i>, from its being bent; and hence the game itself is
frequently called <i>bandy-ball</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And how is it played?” asked Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is played on a smooth common, by driving forward two small hard
balls, with the <i>bandy</i> I have just described, into very distant holes
in the ground, about a foot deep, and nine inches over: and the party
whose ball is driven into these holes with the fewest strokes, is the
victor.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“But come,” said Mr. Seymour, “it is high time to think of our dinner;
the children must require some refreshment. I am not, my dear vicar,
one of those philosophers who believe that play was invented by the
Lydians<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c017'><sup>[32]</sup></a> as a remedy against hunger; nor do I subscribe to the
opinion of the elder Scriblerus, that it was on such an account wisely
contrived by Nature, that children who have the keenest appetites
should, at the same time, be those who are most addicted to sport.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Whether you believe or not that the Lydians invented sports shall not
be a subject of contest between us,” said the reverend antiquary;
“but,” continued
<span class='pageno' title='159' id='Page_159'></span>he, “one thing is quite certain, that the Lydian games were at first
called <i>Lydi</i> by the Romans; and afterwards, by corruption, <i>Ludi</i>; a
presumption I must needs say in favour of the Lydian claim; but enough
of this: to what do you propose we should next turn our attention? I
doubt not you have some new sport for our recreation as well as our
instruction,” added the vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>“We will, if you please, attend the children to their <i>see-saw</i>, which
the gardener has lately constructed for them,” said Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>The party accordingly walked to the grove, in which a plank had been
placed across a wooden post: and upon which Tom and John had been
riding for some time in the earlier part of the morning. The boys
again mounted their new hobby; and, after amusing themselves for some
minutes, Mr. Seymour desired them to stop, in order that Tom might
explain the principle upon which the <i>see-saw</i> acted. Tom replied,
that he was not aware of any principle which could apply to riding on
a plank.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Have I not often told you, my dear boy, that the principles of
Natural Philosophy may be brought to bear on the most trivial acts of
life? Listen, therefore, and you shall find that your present
amusement teems with instruction. You are already well acquainted with
the nature and operations of the centre of gravity; tell me,
therefore, whereabouts it lies in the plank upon which you are
riding.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I should think,” replied Tom, “that in this instance, the centres of
gravity and magnitude must coincide, or be very nearly in the same
point.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The centre of gravity must, as you say, be very nearly in the middle
of the board; and if that be the case, you will allow that, supposing
those who ride upon it are of equal weight, the plank must be
supported in the centre to make the two arms equal; but you and John
are of unequal weight, so that you perceive
<span class='pageno' title='160' id='Page_160'></span>the plank must be drawn a little farther over the prop to make the arms
unequal; and John, who is the lightest, must be placed at the
extremity of the largest arm. Thus arranged, you will exactly balance
each other; and as each of you, on your descent, touches the ground
with your feet, the reaction affords you a spring, which destroys the
equilibrium, and enables you to oscillate in arcs about the centre of
motion.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id019'>
<img src='images/figp177.png' alt='' class='ig019' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>“Do we then describe the arcs of a circle as we ascend and descend?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Undoubtedly you must. Look at this diagram,” said Mr. Seymour, “and
you will see at once that the plank can only move round its centre of
motion; for how could you rise, or your brother fall, perpendicularly
in a straight line? You must, in rising, and he, in descending,
describe arcs of your respective circles. It is equally evident that
his velocity must be very superior to yours; for, if you could swing
quite round, you would each complete your respective circles in the
same time.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It would really appear so,” said Tom; “and I
<span class='pageno' title='161' id='Page_161'></span>have myself observed, that the lighter person has the better ride, as he
moves both farther and quicker, and I now understand the reason of it;
it is because being farther from the centre of motion, he describes a
larger arc.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The greater velocity with which your little brother moves, renders
his momentum equal to yours. You have the most gravity, he the
greatest velocity; so that, upon the whole, your momenta are equal:
for you, no doubt, remember that momentum is weight multiplied into
velocity.<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c017'><sup>[33]</sup></a> You have here then a striking instance of mechanical
advantage gained by opposing motion to matter, or velocity to weight;
for I think you will readily admit, that without the aid of the plank,
your little brother could never have raised you from the ground.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“That is clear enough,” said Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The plank, then, thus arranged,” continued his father, “constitutes
what has been termed a <i>mechanical power</i>, to which the name of
<i>lever</i> has been given; it is not, however, my intention at present to
enter into the history of these powers, of which there are six
distinct kinds; the one presented to you, in the instance of the
<i>see-saw</i>, is perhaps the most simple, and not the least important of
them.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is very curious,” observed the vicar, “to reflect upon what a
simple, and apparently trifling fact, the powers of civilized man may
be said to depend. The single truth you have just announced, of making
velocity a compensation for weight, has supplied his weak arm with the
means of controlling the very elements.”<a href='#note23'>(23)</a></p>

<p class='c016'>“It is very true,” said Mr. Seymour, “and we might go so far as to say
that, had it been the will of the Almighty Creator of the universe to
have withheld from matter that property which we have been
discussing,
<span class='pageno' title='162' id='Page_162'></span>man must have remained the most helpless and forlorn of his creatures. I
now propose,” added Mr. Seymour, “to accompany the children to their
swing; the present is a suitable opportunity for giving them some idea
of the doctrine of oscillation, or the theory of the pendulum.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Let us proceed, then, to the <i>Icarian Game</i>,” exclaimed the vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>As the party walked along, Mr. Twaddleton explained the meaning of the
above allusion, with which the reader will be hereafter made
acquainted. The children had commenced the sport, and Mr. Seymour
informed Tom and Louisa, who were attentively watching the motions of
the swing, that its vibrations, like those of the pendulum of a clock,
were produced by its effort to fall, from the force of gravity, and
its power of ascending through an arc similar and opposite to that
through which it has descended, from the momentum acquired during its
descent.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Like the bandilor, I suppose,” said Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Exactly, my dear, that is a very good comparison; for as the
bandilor, having descended along the string by its gravity, acquires
such a momentum as to enable it to ascend the same string, and thus,
as it were, to wind itself up; so does the pendulum or swing, during
its descent, acquire a force that carries it up in an opposite arc to
an equal height as that from which it had fallen. But tell me, Tom,
whether you have not discovered that the motion of your new swing
differs from that which you experienced in your former one?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The ropes of our present swing are so much longer than those which we
formerly used, that the motion is much pleasanter.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Is that all?” said Mr. Seymour. “Have you not observed that you also
swing much slower?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I have certainly noticed that,” said Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is a law which I am desirous of impressing
<span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span>upon your memory, that the shorter the pendulum, or swing, the quicker are
its motions, and <i>vice versâ</i>; indeed, there is an established
proportion between the velocity and the length, which I shall,
hereafter, endeavour to explain to you. Galileo, the celebrated
philosopher, and mathematician to the Duke of Florence, accordingly
proposed a method of ascertaining the height of the arched ceiling of
a church by the vibrations of a lamp suspended from it. The solution
of the problem was founded on the law to which I have just alluded,
viz. that <i>the squares of the times of the vibrations are as the
lengths</i>; so that a pendulous body, four times the length of another,
performs vibrations which last twice as long. Now it is known that, in
the latitude of London, a pendulum, if 39 inches and two tenths in
length, will vibrate seconds, or make 60 swings in a minute; by
observing, therefore, how much the pendulous body deviates from this
standard, we may, by the application of the above rule, find its
length; if the distance from the bottom of the lamp to the pavement be
then measured, which may be done by means of a stick, and added to the
former result, the sum will give the height of the arch above the
pavement: but I will show you the experiment the next time we go into
Overton church; the vicar can tell us the exact height of the roof,
and I will try how nearly I can approach the truth, by observing with
a stop-watch how many seconds one vibration of the chandelier
continues.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“But, papa, why surely the duration of its vibration must depend upon
the force which you may happen to give to the chandelier?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Not in the least; and this brings us at once to the consideration of
the most curious and important fact in the history of the pendulum,
and for a knowledge of which we are also indebted to Galileo.<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c017'><sup>[34]</sup></a> It
<span class='pageno' title='164' id='Page_164'></span>is termed <i>isochronous</i><a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c017'><sup>[35]</sup></a> property, or that by which all its
vibrations, whether great or small, are performed in exactly the same
period of time; but that you may be better able to comprehend this
subject, attend to the diagram which I have prepared for your
instruction.</p>
<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/figp181.png' alt='Drawing of a pendulum and its movements.' class='c037' />
</div>
<p class='c016'>Suppose that the swing or pendulum <b><span class='fss'>A B</span></b> be raised to <b><span class='fss'>C</span></b>, it
will, in effect, be raised the perpendicular height <b><span class='fss'>E C</span></b>, and in
falling will describe the arc <b><span class='fss'>C B</span></b>; and, in the point <b><span class='fss'>B</span></b>, it will have
that velocity which is acquired by descending through <b><span class='fss'>C B</span></b>, or by a
body falling freely through the perpendicular <b><span class='fss'>C E</span></b>. This velocity will
be sufficient to cause it to ascend through an equal arc <b><span class='fss'>B D</span></b>, to the
same height from whence it fell at <b><span class='fss'>C</span></b>; and since the times of ascent
and descent are equal, it will describe both these arcs in exactly the
same space of time. Having lost all its motion at <b><span class='fss'>D</span></b>, it will again
begin to descend by its own gravity; and in the lowest point <b><span class='fss'>B</span></b> it will
acquire the same velocity as before, which will cause it to reascend
to <b><span class='fss'>C</span></b>; and thus, by ascending and descending, it will perform continual
vibrations in the circumference <b><span class='fss'>C B D</span></b>; and, were it not for the
resistance of the air, and the friction at the centre of motion <b><span class='fss'>A</span></b>, the
vibrations would never cease: but from these obstructions, though
small, it happens, that the velocity of the mass of matter at <b><span class='fss'>B</span></b> is a
little diminished in every vibration; and consequently it does not
return precisely to the same points <b><span class='fss'>C</span></b> or <b><span class='fss'>D</span></b>, but the arcs described
continually become shorter and shorter, till at length they grow
insensible; and yet the very same time is required for the performance
of the shorter as the longer arcs; for,
<span class='pageno' title='165' id='Page_165'></span>although in the one case the body passes over less space, still its velocity is
proportionally decreased. You perceive, then, that in an attempt to
ascertain the height of a ceiling by the vibrations of a chandelier,
the extent of its swing cannot alter the time which may be required
for its completion. And, if you will place your little brother in the
swing, you will perceive that he will return to your hand in nearly
the same space of time, whether he describes a large or small arc;
although this experiment must be considered as extremely rude, since
there are many disturbing causes for which the theory cannot possibly
make any allowance. I must, moreover, warn you that where the arc
described is very considerable, the difference in the time will be
greater; for, in order to ensure this property of vibrating through
unequal arcs in equal times, it is necessary that the path of the body
should describe a peculiar curve, called a cycloid<a href='#note24'>(24)</a>, and not the
segment of a circle; at present, however, it is not possible for us to
enter into this difficult branch of science, although I trust that at
some future period I shall be justified in an attempt to explain it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour having concluded his lecture, was about to return to the
Lodge, when Mrs. Seymour approached the party, carrying in her hands a
letter, which the smile on her countenance announced to contain
agreeable intelligence.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I have just received,” said Mrs. Seymour, “a letter from Miss
Villers, whom you must all remember as a most delightful person. I am
informed that she is about to be married to the nephew of a gentleman
who is at present in our neighbourhood in search of a country
residence.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Does she mention the gentleman’s name?” inquired the vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Mr. Henry Beacham,” said Mrs. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The nephew of Major Snapwell, I declare,” exclaimed the delighted
vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='166' id='Page_166'></span>The whole party participated in the pleasure which their excellent
friend expressed at this discovery, and Mr. Seymour immediately
accompanied Mr. Twaddleton to Ivy Lodge, to congratulate the major,
and to make such arrangements as might expedite the purchase of
Osterley Park, and the consequent introduction of a family into the
neighbourhood of Overton, from whose society the Seymours anticipated
the highest satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c016'>At the same time Mrs. Seymour hastened to dispatch a letter to Miss
Villers, in order to solicit her immediate presence at Overton Lodge.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Why, Tom!” exclaimed Mr. Seymour, “how came you possessed of such a
multitude of marbles?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“By luck; good luck, papa; I won them all before the holidays; and I
can assure you that my school-fellows acknowledge me as one of the
best players at <i>ring-taw</i> in the school.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Justly, then, has your merit been rewarded,” said the father. “Have
you not read of the skilful Roman, who could blow peas through a
quill, and deposit them with such nicety on the point of a pin, placed
at some distance, as rarely to miss his aim?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And what was his reward?” asked Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“A bushel of peas, my boy, which the emperor commanded to be presented
to him. But do not misunderstand me, far be it from my wish to
disparage your skill; whatever we undertake, we should endeavour to
accomplish; I am, therefore, well pleased to find that you can play at
marbles with so much success.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I wonder who invented marbles?” said Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“That question, my dear, must be addressed to Mr. Twaddleton, who, I
have no doubt, will immediately answer it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Scarcely had these words been spoken, when the vicar appeared on the
lawn. Mr. Seymour informed him of the subject of their conversation,
and added, that he had just told the children he was sure he would
readily answer their question.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Not so readily as you may imagine,” replied the vicar; “but I will
tell you all I know upon the subject. It appears to be a very ancient
game; for it is stated by
<span class='pageno' title='169' id='Page_169'></span>Suetonius, that Augustus, when a youth, spent many hours in the day in playing
with little Moorish boys ‘<i>cum nucibus</i>,’ that is, <i>with nuts</i>, which
appear to have been then used in the very way in which you now play
with your marbles. In later times, round stones, picked out of gravel,
were introduced for this purpose. The marbles which you now hold in
your hand are substitutes of still more modern invention. The best of
them are imported from Holland, where, as I have been informed, they
are manufactured by grinding fragments of alabaster and of other
stones, in an iron mill of a peculiar construction, in which there are
several partitions furnished with rasps, which turn with great
velocity, by means of a stream of water; and thus, having rounded the
stones, project them out of different holes for which their size may
adapt them. Thus manufactured, they are brought down the Rhine, and
from thence dispersed throughout Europe; immense quantities are also
exported to India and China. There are, however, as you well know,
inferior kinds, which are of home manufacture, and consist of potter’s
clay covered with a glaze, and burnt in a furnace.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I have often wondered what is the meaning of the words <i>taw</i> and
<i>ally</i>,” observed Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Why, your <i>taw</i> is a brown marble, and your <i>ally</i>, if I remember
rightly, a very white one; is it not so?” asked the vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>“To be sure,” said Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Very well, then,” said the vicar, “the words are clearly
abbreviations of <i>tawny</i> and <i>alabaster</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Now then,” said Mr. Seymour, “for a game; what is it to be, Tom?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“<i>Ring-taw</i> for ever!” cried Tom; “it is the only game of marbles
worthy of being played.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is really so long since I left school,” observed his father, “that
I must beg you to refresh my memory, and give me some instructions
about this favourite game of yours.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='170' id='Page_170'></span>“I will tell you all about it. We must first draw a circle, on which
each player is to put a certain number of marbles to be previously
agreed upon; we then make a mark at some distance, which is called the
<i>offing</i>, and from which we are to shoot at the marbles in the ring.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“That is all very intelligible,” observed his father; “and I suppose
the object of the player is to shoot a marble out of the ring, which
not only gives him that marble, but entitles him to shoot again at
another, and so on, until he misses, or all the marbles are won.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“That is right, papa.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And a good marksman,” observed the vicar, “who has the first shot,
may easily win the game, before any other player can gain the
opportunity of shooting at a single marble.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I see that clearly,” said Mr. Seymour; “he may strike out a marble
from the circle, and then shoot at another, and in this manner
traverse the whole ring; I therefore conclude, that good players will
always demand a large ring, or else there would not be much chance for
any one, except for him who played first.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“That is the game; but I must tell you,” said Tom, “that if the player
should leave his own marble in the ring, he is at once put out; and
should it be within a certain distance on the outside, an adversary
may shoot at it, and by hitting it, put him also out of the game.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I believe that I am now a perfect master of the subject,” said Mr.
Seymour; “what say you, vicar?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I understand it; and it appears to me to be capable of some
scientific calculation; but the practical results must, of course,
differ very widely from the theory, for the unevenness of the ground,
and the inaccurate construction of the marble, are circumstances which
never can be duly estimated.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Certainly not,” replied Mr. Seymour; “these difficulties
<span class='pageno' title='171' id='Page_171'></span>even exist at the game of billiards<a href='#note25'>(25)</a>, where the table is smooth and
perfectly horizontal: but we do not require perfect accuracy, an
approximation to it will be sufficient for the purposes of
illustration; we will, therefore, if you please, proceed at once to
the game, and I will endeavour to point out to Tom the nature and
direction of the several forces by which each marble will be
influenced.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Tom, accordingly, like the son of Cornelius Scriblerus, converted his
legs into a pair of compasses, and described, with the toe of his
shoe, the necessary circle upon the ground. Each party, by agreement,
placed two marbles upon the ring, and it fell to the lot of the vicar
to open the campaign. Mr. Twaddleton then advanced, and with the
assumed air of a true knight-errant, approached the ring, exclaiming
with a loud voice, and with a gesture of inexpressible drollery, “I
demand gracious leave that I may be delivered of my vow, and forthwith
combat in the lists;” so saying, he unfurled his red banner, and
sounded a trumpet; or in more humble phraseology, he extracted his
hand-kerchief from his pocket, and applying it to his nasal organs,
produced a loud and thrilling blast, which frightened every sparrow
from its resting-place. After this preliminary ceremonial, he
marshalled his limbs into the most appropriate attitude, and thrusting
one hand behind the exuberant tail of his coat, he, with the other,
shot forth his missile at the largest marble opposite to him. His
<i>taw</i> faithfully delivered its errand, and inflicted such a blow upon
the paunch of his antagonist, that although nearly twice the size of
its assailant, like a true bully, it skulked off, and retreated
several feet beyond the lists; but, alas! the little marble of the
vicar, unlucky wight! was so stunned by the operation, that it
staggered, and reeled backwards into the ring, and thus, according to
the established law of the field, completed by one act the total
defeat of its luckless commander.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='172' id='Page_172'></span>“Your marble is left in the ring!” exclaimed Tom, with a shout of
triumph.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I see how it happened,” said Mr. Seymour; “the vicar struck the
marble plump, or ‘played a full ball,’ as we say at billiards, and the
result easily admits of explanation. You already know that a marble
possesses elasticity; when, therefore, the one in the ring was struck,
it went off with a velocity equal to that with which the striking
marble approached it, while the latter, in return, received a blow
equal to that it gave, which destroyed its motion. When we go back
into the library, I will exhibit a very pretty experiment in farther
elucidation of this philosophical truth.”<a href='#note26'>(26)</a></p>

<p class='c016'>It was now Mr. Seymour’s turn to enter the lists. He carefully applied
his knuckles to the ground, and taking aim at a little marble which he
had selected as his victim, gallantly shot the missile from his thumb
and finger; but, alas! alas! the goddess, whatever may be her name,
who presides over this species of tournay, doubtless saw the impending
fate of her favourite, and, after the example of Venus, who turned
aside the weapon from Æneas, assumed the shape of a small pebble, and
thus arrested the fatal course of the marble, and gave it a new
direction, which sent it curveting through the ring, without
committing one single act of devastation.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Bravo! bravo!” exclaimed Tom, “it is now my turn.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The boy, according to the usage of the field, might at once have won
the game by striking his father’s marble; but he was too magnanimous
to take such an advantage, and too eager to display his own skill, to
cut the game short by a manœuvre: he had determined to win his
laurels by hard fighting and generalship. He accordingly proceeded to
strike a ring marble; in effecting which he had, like the vicar,
challenged a <i>gigantic knight</i> as his antagonist; but, instead of
<span class='pageno' title='173' id='Page_173'></span>striking it <i>plump</i>, he struck its upper quarter, so that it was
rolled out of the ring, while the striking marble, imparting only a
portion of its momentum, continued to move forward after the impact.
This course was greeted with the acclamations of Mr. Seymour and the
vicar, the latter of whom declared it to have been “nobly run,” and
gallantly accomplished; and extracting a sixpence from his waistcoat
pocket, exclaimed, after the manner of chivalry, “<i>Largesse,
largesse</i>, glory to the sons of the brave! glory to the invincible
knight of the taw!”</p>

<p class='c016'>The boy had not only struck the marble out of the ring, but he had, at
the same time, contrived to place his own marble in the most
favourable position for his future operations; and, indeed, it may be
here observed, that in this consists the art of playing the game. It
is almost unnecessary to add that Tom won every marble in succession.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour then proceeded to explain the laws of impact, by which the
movement of each marble was directed. He observed, that the subject
embraced two propositions, viz. the direction of the <i>object</i> marble
after having been struck, and that of the <i>striking</i> marble after the
stroke. He said that, if a straight line were drawn between the
centres of the striking and object marbles, it would necessarily pass
through their point of contact, and, if continued, would represent the
path of the latter after the blow. In order to find the direction of
the <i>striking</i> marble after the shock, he told him that he must
imagine a tangent to the path of the <i>object</i> ball drawn from its
centre, and then a line parallel to it, from the centre of the
striking marble; the latter of which would be the required path.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour now inquired whether there was any other game of marbles
at which they could amuse themselves.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The game which we call ‘<i>lagging out</i>,’” replied the boy, “is amusing
enough. It consists in striking
<span class='pageno' title='174' id='Page_174'></span>your marble against the wall, and making it rebound, so as to hit any other
marble that is placed at a certain distance from it, or to come within
a span of it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I understand,” said his father, “and, like <i>ring-taw</i>, it may be made
subservient to our purpose of illustrating the doctrine of forces;
although I think that the principle of <i>reflected motion</i> may be more
readily explained by the rebounding ball.”</p>

<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/figp191.png' alt='Diagram showing the physics of rebounding.' class='c040' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour here took the elastic ball, and threw it obliquely against
the wall, from which it rebounded in an opposite and equally oblique
direction. He then sketched the annexed figure, and proceeded as
follows:--“When I threw the ball against the wall <b><span class='fss'>B</span></b>, in the direction
<b><span class='fss'>A B</span></b>, having struck it, it glanced off, making an angle, in its passage
back again, equal to that which it made in its approach to the wall.
If I draw the perpendicular <b><span class='fss'>B D</span></b>, this fact will be rendered more
apparent, and you will perceive that the angle <b><span class='fss'>A B D</span></b> is equal to the
angle <b><span class='fss'>C B D</span></b>: the former is termed the <i>angle of incidence</i>, the latter
the <i>angle of reflection</i>; and these angles, remember, are always
equal, provided the ball under experiment be perfectly elastic.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Do you mean to say,” asked Tom, “that the more obliquely I throw the
ball against the wall, the more obliquely it will rebound?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Exactly; that is my meaning: and see whether you cannot explain the
fact, for it depends on the composition and resolution of the forces,
a subject which I should hope you thoroughly understand.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Tom pondered for some time over the drawing, and at length observed,
that there was one difficulty which he could not immediately surmount.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='175' id='Page_175'></span>“State your difficulty,” said Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>He proceeded to observe, that the force acting in the direction <b><span class='fss'>A B</span></b>
would certainly be resolved into two others, viz. one in the direction
<b><span class='fss'>F B</span></b>, and another in that of <b><span class='fss'>D B</span></b>; “because,” continued he, “these lines
are the adjacent sides of the parallelogram, of which <b><span class='fss'>A B</span></b> is the
diagonal; and I well know that whenever a force strikes obliquely, it
is thus resolved.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“That is all very well explained,” replied his father; “pray proceed.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Now comes the difficulty,” continued Tom; “for the force <b><span class='fss'>D B</span></b> will of
course be destroyed by the wall, and that represented by <b><span class='fss'>F B</span></b>, which is
the only one that can remain, would carry the ball to <b><span class='fss'>E</span></b>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It certainly would do so,” answered his father, “if the ball were
perfectly devoid of elasticity; but remember that, in consequence of
this property, the force <b><span class='fss'>D B</span></b> will be exchanged for one in an opposite
direction, <b><span class='fss'>B D</span></b>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I had entirely overlooked the elasticity,” said Tom; “I now see my
way clearly, for in that case there must be two forces acting in the
directions <b><span class='fss'>B D</span></b>, <b><span class='fss'>B E</span></b>, which will, of course, drive the ball down the
diagonal <b><span class='fss'>B C</span></b>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Your demonstration is perfectly correct, my boy; and I think you will
now admit that I could not have adduced a more beautiful instance of
the composition and resolution of forces; for, in the first place, you
resolve the diagonal force into two others, and then you recompound
these again to produce another diagonal one.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“But I think you told us that the angles of incidence and reflection
were only equal when the rebounding body was perfectly elastic.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Clearly so; the force <b><span class='fss'>D B</span></b> must be exchanged for an equal one <b><span class='fss'>B D</span></b>, or
else the angle <b><span class='fss'>A B D</span></b> cannot be equal to the angle <b><span class='fss'>D B C</span></b>;
but I will
render this fact
<span class='pageno' title='176' id='Page_176'></span>still farther intelligible by another diagram.</p>
<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/figp193.png' alt='Diagram showing more physics of rebounding.' class='c047' />
</div>
<p class='c016'>Let <b><span class='fss'>B</span></b>, as in the former
case, represent the wall, upon which the imperfectly elastic body
impinges in the direction <b><span class='fss'>A B</span></b>.--The force will of course be resolved
into two others, viz. into <b><span class='fss'>D B</span></b> and <b><span class='fss'>F B</span></b>; the force <b><span class='fss'>D B</span></b>, however,
instead of being replaced by the opposite one <b><span class='fss'>B D</span></b>, will now be
represented by the shorter line <b><span class='fss'>B G</span></b>; or that of <b><span class='fss'>B H</span></b> or <b><span class='fss'>B I</span></b>, according
to the degree of elasticity. If we, therefore, complete the
parallelogram, <b><span class='fss'>B C</span></b>, <b><span class='fss'>B K</span></b>, or <b><span class='fss'>B M</span></b> will be the diagonal path of the body;
making, as you perceive, the <i>angle of reflection</i> <b><span class='fss'>D B C</span></b>, greater than
that of <i>incidence</i> <b><span class='fss'>A B D</span></b>; and where the body is perfectly inelastic,
the force <b><span class='fss'>D B</span></b> will be wholly destroyed, and, the force <b><span class='fss'>B E</span></b> alone
surviving, the body will be carried along the line <b><span class='fss'>B E</span></b>. I have now,”
continued Mr. Seymour, “explained to you the principal laws which
govern those forces by which your ball or marbles are actuated. It is
true that in practice you cannot expect the results should accurately
coincide with the theory, because, in the first place, you cannot
obtain marbles that are of equal density and elasticity, and of true
figure; and, in the next, there will be obstacles against which it is
impossible to guard. The spinning of the marble will also have a
material influence on its motion, as we have already discovered. In
the game of billiards, where every obstacle is removed, as far as art
can assist, the theory and practice are often strangely discordant.
But we have dwelt sufficiently upon the subject; we will, therefore,
return to the library, where I intend to exhibit an experiment in
farther elucidation of the subject of collision.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The party accordingly proceeded on their return.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I hope,” said Mr. Seymour, addressing himself to
<span class='pageno' title='177' id='Page_177'></span>Mr. Twaddleton, who was walking a few paces before him, “that the
maiden ladies have not espied their vicar at a game of marbles; if
they should, what a chuckling would there be at their next tea-party!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“A fig for the spinsters!” exclaimed the vicar, as he hastily turned
round, and arrested the progress of the party by his gesture. “You
really speak, Mr. Seymour, as though it were derogatory to my
character to descend from the more austere pursuits to the simple but
innocent amusements of youth. Let me remind you, sir, that the Persian
ambassadors found Agesilaus, the Lacedæmonian monarch, riding on a
stick.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“True,” replied Mr. Seymour; “and the ambassadors found Henry the
Fourth playing on the carpet with his children; and it is said, that
Domitian, after he had possessed himself of the Roman empire, amused
himself by catching flies; but these were kings: now I admit that
philosophers are monarchs, but monarchs are not always philosophers;
you must, therefore, produce some less objectionable authority, if you
stand in need of such a sanction. Let me see whether I cannot assist
you; there was Socrates, if tradition speaks truly, who was partial to
the recreation of riding on a wooden horse, for which, as Valerius
Maximus tells us, his pupil Alcibiades laughed at him.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I care not who laughs at me,” exclaimed the vicar; “I enjoy the
amusements of youth, and agree with Dr. Paley, in regarding the
pleasure which they are made to afford, as a striking instance of the
beneficence of the Deity; and should you so far relax as to put your
plan into execution, of writing a work upon juvenile sports, I hope
you will call upon me to compose a eulogy, by way of preface.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I shall not forget your offer, depend upon it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Did not Archytas,” resumed the vicar,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c043'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<b>‘He who would scan the earth, and ocean’s bound,</b></div>
      <div class='line'><b>And tell the countless sands that strew the shore,’</b></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>as Horace says, invent the children’s rattle?--Toys, my
<span class='pageno' title='178' id='Page_178'></span>dear sir, have served to unbend the wise, to occupy the idle, to
exercise the sedentary, to moralize the dissipated,”--</p>

<p class='c016'>“And,” interrupted Mr. Seymour, “to instruct the ignorant.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I will also convince you,” continued the vicar, “that the tournaments
were indebted for their origin to the Troy game (<i>ludus Trojæ</i>), first
introduced into Italy by young Ascanius.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The foregoing episode having been concluded, the party proceeded,
without any farther interruption, to the Lodge. On their arrival, Mr.
Seymour produced a piece of apparatus, for the purpose of exhibiting
the experiment he had promised, in illustration of the doctrine of the
Collision of Elastic Bodies.</p>

<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/figp195a.png' alt='Two suspended balls colliding.' class='c048' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>“Here are two ivory balls,” said he, “suspended by threads; I shall
draw one of them, <b><span class='fss'>A</span></b>, a little on one side; now I let it go, it
strikes, you see, against the other ball, <b><span class='fss'>B</span></b>, and drives it off to a
distance equal to that through which the first ball fell; but the
motion of <b><span class='fss'>A</span></b> is stopped, because, when it struck <b><span class='fss'>B</span></b>, it received in
return a blow equal to that it gave, and its motion was consequently
destroyed. To extend the experiment, here are six ivory balls hanging
in a row; I will draw the first out of the perpendicular, and let it
fall against the second; see! see! none of the balls appear to move
except the last, which you perceive flies off as far as the first ball
fell. I should like to hear you explain this.”</p>

<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/figp195b.png' alt='Six balls suspended from a rod' class='c040' />
</div>
<p class='c016'>Tom observed, that when the first ball struck the second, it received
a blow, in return, which destroyed its motion; and that the second
ball, although it did not appear to move, must have struck against the
third, the reaction of which set it at rest; that the action of the
third ball must have been destroyed by the
<span class='pageno' title='179' id='Page_179'></span>reaction of the fourth, and so on, until motion was communicated to
the last ball, which not being reacted upon flew off.</p>

<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/figp196.png' alt='Two suspended, inelastic balls showing positions before and after one collides with the other.' class='c049' />
</div>
<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour commended Tom for his explanation; but he begged him to
understand that such an effect only occurred when the balls were
elastic; and he proceeded to exhibit the difference between elastic
and inelastic bodies by another experiment. “When you raise one of
these inelastic balls, made of clay, out of the perpendicular, and let
it fall against the other, <b><span class='fss'>E</span></b>, the action and reaction not being
augmented by the force of elasticity, are insufficient to destroy the
motion of the former; only part of the motion <b><span class='fss'>D</span></b> will, therefore, be
communicated to <b><span class='fss'>E</span></b>, and the two balls will move together to <i>d e</i>,
which are less distant from the vertical line than the ball <b><span class='fss'>D</span></b> was
before it fell.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Before we close this chapter, we cannot resist the pleasure of
informing our readers that Major Snapwell, in company with his legal
adviser, had quitted Overton, for the purpose of making such
preliminary arrangements as the purchase of an estate must necessarily
require. It is not our intention to accompany them; nor shall we
travel over the plains of parchment, nor wade through the rivers of
ink, which separate the confines of verbal agreement and legal
possession; but claiming the prerogative of authors, we shall dip our
wing in the cup of inspiration, and by a single flourish of our
feathered talisman, at once put the worthy Major in the undisturbed

<p class='c024'>In the course of the ensuing week Mr. and Mrs. Seymour proceeded to
offer their congratulations to the new proprietor of Osterley Park. On
being ushered into the library, they were not a little surprised and
startled by the loud voice of the major, who, addressing Mr.
Twaddleton, exclaimed,</p>

<p class='c016'>“Never will I again suspect the antiquity of your rarities, nor
question the rarity of your antiquities.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='181' id='Page_181'></span>“Mr. and Mrs. Seymour,” said the major, “welcome to Osterley Park. You
find me, as usual, engaged with our friend in a learned controversy,
and I begin to fear that my warmth may have offended him.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Offended me!” exclaimed the vicar, “oh no. No, indeed, my dear Major
Snapwell; a difference of opinion on an antiquarian subject may excite
my regret, and in some cases, as in the present instance, awaken my
pity; but it cannot offend me; it can never occasion any feeling like
anger: that would be to visit the folly of others upon myself.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“What is the subject of your difference, gentlemen?” asked Mr.
Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The evidences of druidical rites, as deducible from certain cavities
to be found in granitic rocks, and which have received the appellation
of <i>rock basins</i>,” replied the major.</p>

<p class='c016'>“And of which,” exclaimed Mr. Twaddleton, “I have a most
unquestionable specimen, collected by no less a geologist than the
curator of the cabinet at Penzance, from that ancient metropolis of
the druids, <i>Carn-bre hill</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I admit,” said the major, “that I never before saw so perfect a
specimen; it is as spheroidal internally, as if it had been actually
shaped by a turning-lathe.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And yet, in spite of such evidence,” replied the vicar, “you question
its sacred origin, and deny its ever having been used as a pool of
lustration.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour here interposed. “Upon a subject of purely historical
difficulty, I might feel diffident in offering myself as an umpire
between such learned antiquaries; but, as the origin of ‘rock basins’
involves a geological question, I will venture to deliver an opinion.
Depend upon it, vicar, that you are maintaining a position that cannot
be defended; these uncouth cavities, together with all the fancied
statuary of Borlase<a href='#note27'>(27)</a>,
<span class='pageno' title='182' id='Page_182'></span>never been shaped by any chisel but the tooth of time, nor have any
artists but the elements been engaged in their formation.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“What say you to that, vicar?” triumphantly exclaimed the major.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Oh, impiety, impiety!” cried the vicar;--</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c050'>
    <div>“<b>‘Hostis habet muros, ruit alto a culmine Troja,’</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c029'>as Maro has it. That such glorious monuments, which have so long
braved the tempests, should fall under the hammer of these
Philistines! Geology, Mr. Seymour, is infidelity in masquerade;
remember the mites in the Cheshire cheese, Mr. Seymour, ‘consider
their ways and be wise.’”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Philistines as we are, in your opinion,” replied his opponent, “our
forges have served to sharpen your weapons against the attacks of
infidelity.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Come, come, gentlemen,” said Mr. Seymour, “the continuance of this
discussion can neither amuse nor instruct us. I have, however, some
intelligence to communicate which will soothe every feeling of
irritation. We have received a letter from Isabella Villers, in answer
to an invitation to Overton, and she graciously accepts it, and
proposes being with us on Wednesday next.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The major was delighted, and conversed upon various points connected
with the intended union of his nephew with that lady, which we do not
think it necessary to relate in this place. The vicar and major shook
hands, and it was proposed that they should dine at Overton Lodge the
following day, and, as a specific overture, that the major should
visit the vicarage in his way, and again inspect some of the disputed
antiquities of the reverend collector.</p>

<p class='c016'>The following morning was occupied with the consideration of those
different toys which are indebted for their operation to the pressure
of the atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='183' id='Page_183'></span>“Tom,” said Mr. Seymour, “fetch hither your leathern sucker.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“John is, at this moment, amusing himself in the garden with the one
which I brought with me from school,” replied Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Then you shall construct another for yourself. Here is leather and
string.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“This leather is too stiff; but I may, perhaps, make it answer the
purpose by first soaking it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Having allowed it to remain in water for a short time, the leather
became sufficiently pliable for his purpose; he therefore cut it into
a circular shape, and affixed a string through its centre. The
juvenile party now hastened to the lawn, and having once again dipped
his newly-constructed sucker into the water, the ingenious boy placed
it upon a stone, pressed down the leather with his foot, and succeeded
in making it raise the weight.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well done, my boy! Now, then, explain the reason of the leather’s
adhesion to the surface, and of its being thus capable of retaining
its hold, notwithstanding the gravity of the stone.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“In the first place,” answered Tom, “the edges of the wet leather,
from being closely pressed, stuck with sufficient firmness to the
smooth surface of the stone, to resist the force of the string as I
pulled it upwards; the consequence was, that a hollow was formed in
the middle part of the leather; and, as that hollow place cannot
contain any air, it is called a <i>vacuum</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Very well,” replied his father, “so far you are right; but you have
not informed me in what manner a <i>vacuum</i> acts in preventing the stone
from quitting the leather.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It makes it adhere to it by some kind of <i>suction</i>, but I confess
that I do not exactly understand the subject.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Then let us proceed cautiously and deliberately in the explanation.
In the first place, you have said,
<span class='pageno' title='184' id='Page_184'></span>and said correctly, that the edges of the leather adhere to the stone;
but what is the nature of the power to which this adhesion is to be
referred? I perceive you are puzzled by the question: attend, then, to
my explanation: you must know that there exists a tendency in all
bodies to adhere together, provided the contact of their surfaces be
sufficiently perfect; this property is termed <i>cohesion</i>, or cohesive
attraction, from the Latin word <i>cohæreo</i>, which I need not inform you
signifies to <i>stick together</i>. The dry leather will not adhere to a
smooth surface, because, in that case, the contact cannot be rendered
sufficiently perfect; but, when saturated with water, the interstices
of the leather are filled with that fluid, and the inequalities of the
surface, which must always prevent close contact, are removed. If two
bodies, when placed together, be not sufficiently smooth, or polished,
it will be vain to make any attempt to produce their cohesion; since
the particles will, in such a state, touch each other only in a few
points; it is for this reason that carpenters, when they intend to
glue pieces of wood together, plane the surfaces perfectly smooth,
before they apply the glue.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Tom here acknowledged that he had not before understood the reason of
the leather’s adhesion to the stone.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Having, then, settled this point to your satisfaction,” continued Mr.
Seymour, “let us proceed. Your idea of a <i>vacuum</i> being formed in the
hollow part of the leather is perfectly correct: for, as you draw up
the central part by the string, the hollow thus produced must
necessarily be a <i>vacuum</i>, since the air cannot pass through the
leather to supply it; in this state, therefore, the atmosphere presses
upon the exterior of the leather, and like any other weight prevents
its rising from the stone.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Fanny and Louisa here expressed some surprise on hearing of the weight
of the atmosphere; the former observed, that she did not feel any
pressure from it.
<span class='pageno' title='185' id='Page_185'></span>Their father explained the reason of their not being conscious of the
weight, by informing them that their bodies contained air, which, by
its elasticity, counteracted the pressure from without; but that, if
it were possible to remove all the air which the body contained, the
pressure of the atmosphere would not be counteracted; and the
consequence would be, that we should be flattened like a pancake by
its weight, which had been ascertained by experiment to be equal to
fifteen pounds upon every square inch of surface, or, as much as forty
thousand pounds upon the body of a man of ordinary size.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Until your explanation,” said Tom, “I really believed that the
leather adhered to the stone by some kind of <i>suction</i>, just as the
back of my hand adheres to my lips, whenever I place it to my mouth,
and draw in my breath.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour here expressed a doubt whether his son was even yet a
perfect master of the subject: he told him that there was no such
operation in nature as <i>suction</i>; that it was merely a popular term to
denote the action of the air upon a vacuum. “Your hand,” said he,
“adheres to your mouth, in consequence of your forming a vacuum within
it, by forcibly drawing in your breath, and the resistance which is
opposed to its removal arises entirely from the pressure of the
atmosphere upon it. Many are the effects which may be explained upon a
similar principle. I dare say you well remember the astonishment which
you expressed at the force with which the limpets attached themselves
to the rocks.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“O yes, papa,” exclaimed Louisa, “I well remember, when we walked on
the sea-shore, that, on first touching the limpets, they appeared
loose and moveable, but before I had time to remove them, they
fastened themselves as firmly as though they had been a part of the
rock upon which they were fixed; how could that happen?”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='186' id='Page_186'></span>Mr. Seymour replied, that these sea-insects possessed the power of
converting their whole bodies into <i>suckers</i>; and he informed them,
that many other animals were endowed with a similar faculty. He
instanced the claws of the polypus, which are furnished with many such
suckers, by means of which the animal is enabled to hold to whatever
it attaches itself, with very considerable force.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Have you never observed,” asked Mr. Seymour, “the security and ease
with which flies frequently walk upon a smooth wall, or a pane of
glass, or even along the ceiling, with their bodies downward?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“To be sure,” replied Tom; “but are not their legs provided with some
sticky matter, which enables them to preserve themselves from
falling?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“That is a popular error, my dear; the fact is, that their feet are
provided with little cups, or suckers, which they alternately exhaust
and fill with air; by which means they are enabled to walk in every
position, over the most slippery surfaces.<a href='#note28'>(28)</a> In like manner, the
walrus, or seal, a painting of which you may remember to have seen in
the Panorama of Spitzbergen, is capable of climbing the masses of
slippery ice with perfect security.”</p>

<p class='c016'>At this moment, Tom’s stone fell from the sucker. Louisa enquired how
it could have happened.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The circumstance is to be easily explained,” said her father. “The
atmosphere, by its pressure, ultimately forced its way through the
edges of the sucker; its interior, therefore, became filled with air,
and it consequently balanced the external weight, which had before
confined it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I think,” said the vicar, “that Tom must now surely understand the
theory of the leathern sucker; what say you, my boy? Cannot you
exclaim with Persius, ‘<i>Intus</i> et in <i>cute</i> novi.’”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Which I suppose,” observed Mr. Seymour, “you
<span class='pageno' title='187' id='Page_187'></span>would construe, ‘Well do I know the nature of the <i>cavity</i>, and the
operation of the <i>leather</i>.’”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Exactly,” answered the vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Then never more protest against the vice of punning, for a more
atrocious specimen of the <i>lusus verborum</i> was never sported by the
most incorrigible Johnian: but, to your classical fancy, any object
enclosed in a Latin shrine appears as a deity.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The vicar had just drawn up his person into a suitable attitude for
combat, and would, no doubt, have defended himself against this
unexpected attack with his usual address, had not a circumstance
occurred, which put an abrupt termination to the discourse.</p>

<p class='c016'>“See! see!” exclaimed Louisa; “what can have happened? There is Jerry
Styles, with a crowd of villagers, running towards us in the greatest
state of agitation and alarm.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Jerry Styles? It is, indeed, as you say, my faithful clerk,” cried
the vicar. “Bless me,--bless me, what can have happened! Is the
vicarage on fire? Has the old roof at last tumbled into the chancel?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Oh, sir!--oh, my dear sir!” vociferated the terrified servant of the
church, whose blanched cheeks made his red nose appear like a volcano
burning amidst a desert of snows, “poor Tom Plank has blown the roof
off his house, and is so dreadfully wounded that it is impossible for
him to survive long, if, indeed, he is not already dead.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“How did it happen?” exclaimed several voices.</p>

<p class='c016'>“From a <i>speriment</i>! a <i>speriment</i>! it all came from a <i>flossical
speriment</i>!” replied the breathless clerk; “but, pray, gentlemen, come
directly to the village; for mercy’s sake, gentlemen, don’t delay a
moment.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The vicar and Mr. Seymour instantly proceeded with the terrified Jerry
Styles towards the house of the unfortunate “planer of deals;” they
had not gone
<span class='pageno' title='188' id='Page_188'></span>far before they met several other villagers, who informed them that Dr.
Doseall was in attendance upon the wounded man, and had pronounced him
to be in the greatest danger.</p>

<p class='c016'>On their arrival at the house, the roof of which they at once
perceived had not suffered in the fray, they learned that Tom Plank
had been engaged in some experiments for producing a <i>vacuum</i>, in the
prosecution of his new scheme of propelling passengers through a
funnel; and that, in firing a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen gases, he
had neglected the usual precaution, and blown up his apparatus; the
stop-cock had been unceremoniously expelled through the window, and,
in its passage, had ungraciously flown in the face of its master, and
left the traces of its indignation in the form of a very slight
scratch upon his forehead; this accident, with a burn of the fingers,
was the only personal injury he had sustained.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Come, come,” said Mr. Seymour, “no mischief has occurred, and the
accident will, I trust, teach you more caution for the future. You are
not the first adventurer who has <i>burned</i> his <i>fingers</i> by <i>bubble</i>
speculations, and in vain attempts to <i>raise the wind</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Dr. Doseall, however, with a countenance of stern composure, and a
portentous shake of the head, maintained that the accident was by no
means so trifling as Mr. Seymour appeared to suppose; and, in
conformity with this view of the case, he had prudently bled his
patient largely, and directed sundry mixtures and lotions, together
with a <i>quantum sufficit</i> of laudanum, in order, as he said, “to keep
down the swelling and puffing of the head,” although there were those
present who were uncharitable enough to hint, that the <i>swelling</i> and
<i>puffing</i> related rather to the Doctor’s bill and character, than to
the patient’s pericranium.</p>

<p class='c016'>After a short interval, engaged in answering the numerous enquiries of
the anxious spectators, the doctor, with an air of awful solemnity,
advanced to the sufferer,
<span class='pageno' title='189' id='Page_189'></span>and offered him a bolus of no ordinary size; upon the virtues of which he
descanted in most touching language.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Avaunt!” exclaimed Mr. Seymour, “do you suppose that Tom Plank has
the throat of the great dragon which the Indians believe to swallow
the moon, and thus to produce the phænomena of lunar eclipses? Away
with thy treacle and pipe-clay; there cannot be the least pretext for
this parade of remedies; I warrant you that Dame Nature, unless she be
put out of humour by your officious interference, will heal the
scratch before to-morrow’s sunrise.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The doctor, as our readers will readily imagine, was very justly
incensed at this ex-professional interference. His first determination
was to treat the matter as a joke, and to turn the laugh against the
unmannerly intruder; but the abortive smile was strangled in its
birth, and suffused the hue of death over his visage. Never did a
countenance, in the focus of his blue window bottle, by candle-light,
exhibit a more ghastly pallor; and we can scarcely predict what might
have been the consequence, had he not instantly administered a
consoling cordial to his nostrils; for, be it known, that the doctor
took snuff in the same extravagant proportion as his patients took
physic. Having by these means recovered his self-possession, he
instantly seized his cane, and waving it with as much dignity as Jove
is said to brandish his thunder, he departed in deep dudgeon, which
was betrayed by a snarl, not unlike that of a hungry dog who is
unexpectedly despoiled of a savory bone, and by a contortion of the
face, similar to that we have observed in a child who has
unfortunately mistaken Aloes for Liquorice.</p>

<p class='c016'>No sooner had the man of wrath and phials retreated from the field of
blood, than Mr. Twaddleton advanced to the suffering artist, deeming
the moment of bodily fear as affording a favourable opportunity
<span class='pageno' title='190' id='Page_190'></span>for an attempt to reclaim him from the error of his ways. “Tom Plank,”
said he, in a mild tone, “hadst thou given ear to the warning voice of
thy spiritual pastor, and, instead of ridiculing his advice at the
sixpenny club, hadst, like a true Christian and worthy parishioner,
given heed unto it, thou wouldst not, at this time, have been placed
in such bodily peril. Mr. Seymour has consoled thee by his opinion;
sincerely shall I pray that his judgment may be confirmed by the
result, and that the visitation may have a salutary influence upon thy
future conduct. Quit the pursuit of these bubbles, and leave wiser men
to investigate the secrets of nature; let me exhort thee to return to
thy craft, sow where thou canst reap; we cannot have figs from thorns,
nor grapes from thistles; remember the proverb, ‘an emmet may work its
heart out, but can never make honey.’ One word more and I have
done--suffer not the artist whose profit it is to furnish thee with
materials, to flatter and cajole thee--‘the dog wags his tail, not for
thee, but for thy bread.’”</p>

<p class='c016'>As the party left the house, they met Mrs. Seymour, with Tom and
Louisa, whose looks sufficiently testified the anxiety they had
suffered.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Is it all over? Is he dead?” asked Mrs. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“No, no; he is quite safe; it was an extremely slight accident,
although Doseall wished us to believe that it was likely to terminate
in some dreadful manner. The vicar thinks that it may prove the means
of driving science <i>out</i> of Tom Plank’s head, and I intend to make it
subservient to driving it still farther <i>into</i> ours.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“What do you mean?” cried Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I mean that it was an extremely apposite accident for illustrating
the subject upon which we were engaged at the moment of interruption.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“This is the second accident then,” observed
<span class='pageno' title='191' id='Page_191'></span>Louisa, “that will have served us in our scientific studies. What a
philosopher,” continued she, “must Dr. Doseall become, if he profit by
every accident he witnesses!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Knowledge, my dear girl, is not promoted by the opportunity of
seeing, but by the faculty of skilfully observing, and reflecting upon
what we see; were it otherwise, the merit of a traveller might be at
once estimated by the number of shoes he had worn out. Whenever,
therefore, you hear of a discovery having been made <i>by accident</i>, do
not, on that account, depreciate the merits of its author. It is
certainly true, that many an important truth has been brought to light
from some casual observation<a href='#note29'>(29)</a>, but the dexterity with which such
observation was applied constitutes the merit of the discoverer. Well,
but to show in what manner the accident of Tom Plank bears upon the
subject under discussion:--He had ignorantly fired a quantity of
oxygen and hydrogen gases in a tin vessel; the consequence of the
combustion was the immediate formation of a <i>vacuum</i>: and what
happened? Why, the pressure of the external air, not being any longer
balanced by elastic matter in the interior of the apparatus, crushed
it with violence, as any other enormous weight might have done; and so
ended the accident, which report magnified into a most awful
catastrophe.”</p>

<p class='c016'>As the party proceeded on their way home, they continued to discourse
on the subject of the air’s pressure.</p>

<p class='c016'>“If the atmosphere exerts so enormous a pressure, and has so much
weight,” observed Louisa, “it is strange that it should not fall down
on the earth.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour replied, “that the air was a peculiar fluid, which, from
its elastic properties, was distinguished by the term of an <i>elastic
fluid</i>, the particles of which were too far distant from each other to
exert any cohesive attraction amongst themselves.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='192' id='Page_192'></span>“But I suppose,” said Tom, “that it gravitates, or is attracted by the
earth; what then can be the reason, as Louisa says, that it does not
fall, like any other body, to the ground?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And so it actually does,” replied Mr. Seymour. “The lower stratum of
the atmosphere rests upon the ground, but the strata above it do not
fall, because they are supported by the particles beneath them, in the
same manner as the water at the surface of a basin is supported by
that at the bottom: the only difference in these two cases arises from
the one being an elastic, and the other an inelastic fluid; so that
the air after compression resumes its original dimensions; and since
the atmosphere, by the action of gravity, is always in a state of
compression, so is it always endeavouring to expand itself.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“If, then, the force of gravity were diminished,” observed Louisa,
“the air would become much lighter, and I suppose that is the true
reason of its being so much less dense in the upper regions.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Scarcely,” replied her father. “Have you forgotten the
explanation<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c017'><sup>[36]</sup></a> which I lately gave you, of the diminution in the
weight of bodies at a distance from the earth’s surface?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I recollect it perfectly,” exclaimed Tom; “and it explained to us the
reason that a marble fell from the top of a house, and from the ball
of St. Paul’s with the same velocity.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And yet I am quite sure,” said Louisa, “that I have lately read an
account of the air being so extremely light upon the top of a high
mountain as to affect the breath and occasion great uneasiness.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I do not deny the fact, my dear; I only question your explanation of
its cause. Can it not, think you, be accounted for upon some other
principle than that of the diminished force of gravity?”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='193' id='Page_193'></span>Louisa was unable to suggest any other probable reason.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The fact, then,” said her father, “is simply this; since the air is
elastic, or capable of yielding to pressure, so, of course, the lower
parts must be more dense, or in a greater state of compression than
those which are above them. In a pile of fleeces of wool, are not the
lower fleeces pressed together by the weight of the superior ones, and
do they not lie light and loose, in proportion as they approach the
uppermost fleece, which receives no external pressure, and is confined
merely by the force of its own gravity?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Clearly,” said Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well then, we will suppose, for example, that the whole column of the
atmosphere were divided into a hundred parts, and that each of these
parts weighed an ounce; would not the earth, and all things on its
surface, be, in such a case, pressed upon with the whole hundred
ounces?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“No one can deny that,” said Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The lowest stratum of air,” continued Mr. Seymour, “would be pressed
upon by the ninety-nine ounces above it; the next by ninety-eight; and
so on, until we arrived at the ninety-ninth stratum from the bottom,
which would, of course, be subjected to no more than one ounce of
pressure, or to the weight of the last and highest stratum.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The children were perfectly satisfied with this simple explanation;
and Tom enquired whether, for the same reason, the water at the bottom
of the sea must not be very dense, and unlike that we are accustomed
to observe on the surface: his father, however, corrected this notion,
by stating that water, not being, like air, elastic and compressible,
would not suffer any material diminution in volume, although pressed
even by the enormous weight of the superincumbent ocean.<a href='#note30'>(30)</a></p>

<p class='c016'>“I have before alluded to the relative compressibility of air and
water, and the present appears a good opportunity
<span class='pageno' title='194' id='Page_194'></span>for proving the fact by an amusing experiment. See! here are the ‘<i>Bottle
Imps</i>,’ vicar, which you may remember I promised to introduce to your
respectful notice,” said Mr. Seymour. “In this jar of water, carefully
closed, as you may perceive, by parchment, are two little enamelled
figures, which shall be made to rise and fall, by alternately pressing
upon and removing the hand from the cover: thus.”</p>

<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/figp211.png' alt='Bottle Imps' class='c051' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>“Why, the spirit of Simon Magus must surely possess thee!” exclaimed
the vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>The children, as may be readily imagined, were much astonished at so
singular an effect, and expressed much anxiety to be informed by what
mechanism it was produced. Their father accordingly proceeded with the
following explanation.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I have here,” said he, “a figure exactly similar to those in the
bottle, which we will now examine. You will observe, that in its
centre there is a cavity terminating in a small orifice in the lower
part; this cavity may be made to contain any quantity of air, so as to
give the required buoyancy to the figure: now mark!--I press my hand
upon the parchment cover, and the figure, you perceive, descends; I
now remove the pressure, and see, it immediately reascends. The water
in the bottle, as I have told you, is incompressible; when, therefore,
I press upon the surface, it rises into the interior of the figure,
and, consequently, by compressing the air into a less space, renders
it less buoyant; but no sooner is the hand removed, than the enclosed
air resumes its former volume, and expels the intruding water; in
consequence of which the figure regains its former lightness, and
reascends. Do you understand me?” asked Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='195' id='Page_195'></span>“Perfectly,” said Tom, “and many thanks for the explanation;” and in
this opinion did the whole party concur.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well, then,” continued Mr. Seymour, “you will now understand the use
of the air-bladder in fish, for it is constructed upon a precisely
similar principle. When the fish desires to descend, it presses upon
the bladder by means of its muscles, and thus condenses the included
air into a smaller volume.”<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c017'><sup>[37]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c016'>“I now also perceive why the water at the bottom of the sea cannot be
much more dense than that on the surface; but, if we could dig a pit
to the centre of the earth, the air, in that case, would be highly
dense, because, unlike water, it is compressible,” said Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The density of the air,” replied his father, “would, undoubtedly,
materially increase as we descended. It has been calculated that, at
the distance of thirty miles below the surface, the air would have the
same density as water; and, at the depth of forty-two miles, that of
quicksilver; while, at the centre, it would be more solid than any
substance of which we have any idea, for its density would be
thousands of millions of times greater than that of mercury.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour then informed his young pupils, that after the lesson they
had just received, they would never again be puzzled by the motions of
the barometer, which had so often excited their wonder.</p>

<p class='c016'>“As the quicksilver is contained in a closed tube, I do not exactly
understand how the air can act upon it; and if the tube were not
closed, it would of course run out from its weight,” observed Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You are altogether in error,” said her father. “In the first place,”
he continued, “I will show you that the bulb at the lower extremity of
the tube is open, in order that the quicksilver may freely communicate
<span class='pageno' title='196' id='Page_196'></span>with the atmosphere, upon which, indeed, its action entirely depends;
while the upper space is a perfect vacuum, so as to obviate any
counteracting pressure. As to the quicksilver running out, have you so
soon forgotten that the air presses upon every body on the surface of
the earth, in the proportion of about fifteen pounds upon every square
inch? Now it is from this circumstance that the column of quicksilver
is sustained in the tube, the ascent and descent of which thus
indicates the varying pressure of the atmosphere; so that, when the
barometer falls, we know the air presses less heavily upon the earth,
and the contrary when it rises.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“That I understand: but what can cause the pressure of the air to vary
at different times?” asked Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Cannot you imagine the atmosphere to be an airy ocean, and to be
therefore thrown into enormous waves, so that we may sometimes have a
longer column of air above us than at other times; this is one
explanation, there may be other causes not so intelligible,” answered
Mr. Seymour. “But enough of this for the present. Now, before we quit
the subject of the air’s elasticity, let us consider the philosophy of
the <i>pop-gun</i>; an amusement with which, I have no doubt, you are well
acquainted.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Indeed I am, papa; but do you allude to the quill, or to the wooden
pop-gun?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The principle in both is the same; tell me, therefore, the origin and
nature of the force which enables you to shoot your pellet to so
considerable a distance.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It depends upon the action of the air,” replied Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Undoubtedly: but your answer is too general; I wished you to state,
in precise terms, the changes which the air undergoes upon this
occasion. You first ram in your pellet to the further end of the tube,
do you not?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“To be sure; and then I drive in a second pellet,
<span class='pageno' title='197' id='Page_197'></span>and on forcing this forward, the first flies out with prodigious force.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Very well: now examine what takes place; on propelling forward your
second pellet, you condense the air which is enclosed between the two,
until its elastic force becomes so great as to overcome the friction
of the first pellet; thus released, the air expands with considerable
force, and imparts a rapid motion to the pellet.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I have frequently heard of the air-gun,” said Louisa; “I suppose it
depends upon a similar principle.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It does; and it affords a very striking example of the surprising
force which air is capable of exerting, when condensed to a
considerable degree; for, by means of this instrument, bullets may be
propelled with a force very nearly equal to that of gunpowder.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is a curious fact,” observed the vicar, “that although the
air-pump is a modern invention, yet the air-gun, which is so nearly
allied to it in the construction of its valves and condensing syringe,
should have existed long antecedent to it; for it is recorded that an
air-gun was made for Henry IV. by Marin, of Lisieux, in Normandy, as
early as 1408; and another was preserved in the armoury at Schmetau,
bearing the date of 1474.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“But the air-gun of the present day,” said Mr. Seymour, “is very
different from that which was formerly made, and which, like the
pop-gun, discharged but one bullet, and that after a long and tedious
process of condensation, while it is now made to discharge five or six
without any visible variation of force, and will even act upon a
dozen, but with less effect.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I feel very curious to learn something more about this air-gun,” said
Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“There is a reservoir for the condensed air,” replied Mr. Seymour,
“which is secured by a nicely
<span class='pageno' title='198' id='Page_198'></span>constructed valve, and which is made to open by pulling the trigger of
the gun, so that a portion only of the air is disengaged, which,
rushing into the barrel, gives motion to the ball.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“But how is the condensed air introduced into the reservoir?” asked
Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“By means of a condensing syringe,” replied his father; “but I will
take an opportunity of exhibiting the instrument in operation.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The reader will be pleased to recollect that the major agreed to pay a
passing visit to the vicarage; it now becomes our duty to record what
happened upon that memorable occasion; and we, perhaps, cannot better
represent the nature of the discussion that took place than by
relating the account as it was given by the belligerent parties
themselves in conversation with Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well, gentlemen,” said Mr. Seymour, “is it peace or war? I trust you
have amicably adjusted all your differences.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Upon my word,” answered the vicar, “I have just reason to complain of
the major’s unjustifiable scepticism upon points that are perfectly
unquestionable.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You continue then to smart under the major’s stinging criticisms,
‘<i>majore sub hoste</i>.’ There is a Latin pun for your consolation,” said
Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The vicar alludes, I suppose,” said the major, “to the doubt I
expressed respecting the authenticity of his leathern money?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“That is one of the many subjects upon which, I must say, you have
betrayed a deficiency in historical knowledge. Seneca informs us that
there was anciently stamped money of leather; and the same thing was
put in practice by Frederick II. at the siege of Milan; to say nothing
of an old tradition amongst ourselves, that, in the confused times of
the barons’ wars, the same expedient was practised in England.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='199' id='Page_199'></span>“You strangely mistake me,” replied the major; “I never questioned the
truth of these historical statements; I know full well that numerous
substances have, at different times, and in different countries, been
adopted in exchange, as conventional representatives of property. I
have already stated that cattle were employed as the earliest measure
of value <a href='#note31'>(31)</a>. We find, for instance, in Homer, that the golden armour
of Glaucus was valued at a hundred, and that of Diomedes, at ten oxen.
Among the Indians, <i>cowries</i>, or small shells, are used; and the
Abyssinians employ salt, bricks, and beads for this very purpose; the
ancient Britons are said to have circulated iron rings as money. The
Hollanders, we know, coined great quantities of pasteboard in the year
1754; and Numa Pompilius certainly made money both of wood and
leather.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And yet you doubt the authenticity of my leathern money, which I am
fully persuaded was coined in 1360, by John, king of France, who,
having agreed to pay our Edward the Third the sum of 3,000,000 golden
crowns for his ransom, was so reduced as to be compelled to a coinage
of leather for the discharge of his household expenses.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I have only questioned the authenticity of that specimen which I saw
in your cabinet,” replied the major: “and so must any person who views
it through a medium unclouded by prejudice. I will stake my whole
library to a horn-book, that our friend Mr. Seymour will agree with me
in pronouncing it a fragment of the heel of an old shoe: let him
observe the perforation, and say, if he can, that it has not been
produced by a nail or peg. But really, my dear Mr. Twaddleton, you
have forced me, much against my inclination, into this controversy.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Very good, sir! very good! the heel of an old shoe, forsooth! But I
thank you, Major Snapwell,” exclaimed the vicar with some warmth; “I
thank
<span class='pageno' title='200' id='Page_200'></span>you, sir. Your assertion, while it evinces your own want of historical
information, establishes, beyond doubt, the authenticity of my
treasure, and the triumph of my opinion.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Assuredly,” said Mr. Seymour, with a wicked smile; “I dare say there
may be numerous holes in this leathern coin; for many have been the
antiquaries who have, doubtless, <i>pinned</i> their faith upon it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Psha, psha!” cried the vicar; “for once, at least, Mr. Seymour, let
me entreat you to be serious; the subject, sir, is important, and
merits your respect. It is from that very hole that I am enabled to
identify the coin: yes, major, from that very hole, which you affect
to despise, I am enabled to derive its principal claim to antiquity.
Are we not expressly informed, that the leathern money of John of
France had a little nail of silver driven into it?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well, then,” continued the major, “what say you to that tell-tale
stitch, which I so unfortunately picked out with my penknife?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Admirable ingenuity! most refined sophistry! provoking perversion!”
exclaimed the vicar. “It is really amusing to observe the address with
which the prejudiced observer distorts every fact to his own
advantage. Why, bless me, sir, that stitch is strong enough to drag
fifty such opponents out of the slough of unbelief.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Do explain yourself,” said Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Explain myself! the stitch speaks for itself, sir. Were not these
leathern coins strung together in different numbers, to facilitate
payments? For, you will admit, that it would have been extremely
inconvenient to have coined single pieces of leather, of different
denominations. But stop, sir, stop; look at this, look at it, major,
with care and attention. That,” said the vicar, as he drew a small
coin out of his waistcoat pocket with an air of imperturbable gravity
and self-satisfaction,
<span class='pageno' title='201' id='Page_201'></span>“is a current halfpenny, in lead, of James II; and if your eyes are not
hoodwinked by prejudice, you may probably perceive a piece of copper
in its centre, which, we are told, was thus introduced for the purpose
of rendering the currency lawful.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The dinner was announced before the conclusion of the discussion; and
as the reader will probably agree with us in thinking that a question
of such grave historical importance ought not to be decided without
due care and deliberation, we shall afford the disputants a reasonable
time for reflection, and put an end to the chapter.</p>

  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<p class='c030'><span class='pageno' title='202' id='Page_202'></span><i>The Soap-Bubble.--The Squirt.--The Bellows; An Explanation of
their several parts.--By whom the instrument was invented.--The
sucking and lifting, or common Pump.</i></p>

<p class='c024'>“Tom,” said his father, “bring me a saucer with some hot water; a
piece of soap, and a tobacco-pipe. I have promised to teach John the
art of blowing soap-bubbles.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Tom immediately proceeded to execute his commission, and shortly
rejoined the party on the lawn, bringing with him all the necessary
implements for bubble-blowing. John, under the direction of his
brother, made the lather; and Mr. Seymour, turning towards the elder
children, asked them whether they understood the philosophy of the
operation they had just witnessed; they were, however, unable to
return a satisfactory answer, and their father, therefore, proceeded
as follows:--</p>

<p class='c016'>“Most liquids, by agitation, exhibit the appearance
<span class='pageno' title='203' id='Page_203'></span>of froth, in consequence of the escape of the air in small bubbles, which
had been forced into them by the operation. If, however, the liquid be
viscid and tenacious, like soap and water, the air is, as it were,
imprisoned in the mass, producing the appearance which is commonly
called <i>lather</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Louisa here enquired “Whether the air did not escape with more or less
readiness, according to the degree of resistance it met with in the
liquid?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I thank you,” said Mr. Seymour, “for having so kindly assisted me in
the explanation.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Louisa smiled at this mark of her father’s approbation, and Mr.
Seymour proceeded,--“It is on that very account, that spirit, after it
has been shaken, so soon regains its transparency: for, in consequence
of the superior lightness of that fluid, and the little cohesion which
subsists between its particles, the air makes a rapid escape. In like
manner we may account for the spongy appearance which gives such
superiority to our bread; in that case, the air disengaged during the
fermentation of the dough cannot escape through so viscid a mass; it
therefore remains, and thus produces the eyes or bubbles, which you
may always observe in every well-baked loaf.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“See, papa,” exclaimed Tom, “the bubbles which John has blown in the
lather, are not round, but angular figures--they appear to be like the
hexagons which we used to cut out for our <i>papyro-plastics</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“They are certainly hexagonal,” replied Mr. Seymour; “and the form
arises from the pressure of the bubbles upon each other. The same
appearance is to be seen in the pith of vegetables, when examined by
the microscope, and is the result of the general reaction of the solid
parts upon each other: but let us proceed to blow some bubbles. Plunge
the bowl of the tobacco-pipe into the lather.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Tom obeyed his father’s directions, and blowing through the stem
produced a bubble.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='204' id='Page_204'></span>“See! see!” cried Louisa, “what a beautiful bubble! but there is a
quantity of soap hanging to its under part.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I will take it off with my finger,” said Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“There it goes!” exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“What beautiful colours it displays! as bright and gaudy as those of
the rainbow!” observed his sister.</p>

<p class='c016'>“It has burst!” cried Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Ah! my dear children,” murmured the vicar, with an air of pensive
gravity, “‘<i>Tenues secessit in auras</i>,’ as the poet has it. Even thus
is it with all the full-blown bubbles of our fancy, raised by the
breath of hope; the moment they appear most vivid and promising to our
imagination, they vanish ‘into air, into thin air,’ like the gaudy and
unsubstantial soap-bubble you have just witnessed: but proceed to blow
another.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“There is one!” exclaimed Louisa;--“see, it is of an oblong shape,
like an egg!--there it goes!--but I declare it is now perfectly
round!!--what can be the reason of its changing its figure?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I am glad you have asked that question, because my answer will serve
to illustrate an important property of air, and which, indeed, is
common to all fluids. While the upper part of the bubble was attached
to the bowl of the pipe, its gravity being resisted, drew it into an
elliptical form; but the instant it was detached, the contained air
pressed equally in all directions, and the bubble, in consequence,
became a perfect sphere.”<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c017'><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c016'>“I do not exactly understand what you mean ‘by pressing equally in all
directions.’”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='205' id='Page_205'></span>“The expression is surely sufficiently intelligible. Did you not learn
in our conversation of yesterday, that air has weight, and exerts a
pressure as much upwards as downwards and laterally? Were this not the
case, how could the air in the interior of our bodies counteract the
pressure of the atmosphere? The form of the bubble proves the same
fact in a different way; for, had the air in its cavity pressed more
in any one direction than in another, the bubble could not have been
round, or, to speak more correctly, a sphere.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“What are you musing about?” cried the vicar, who had observed the
attention of the boy riveted upon the bowl of the tobacco-pipe: “I am
sure, from your countenance, that some circumstance is puzzling you.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You are right, my dear sir; I was just then thinking how it can
possibly happen, that the bubble should not have a hole in its upper
part; for, while I am blowing it up, there must, of course, be a
communication between my mouth and its interior, or else how could the
air pass into it?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“True,” said his father; “but the act of throwing it off from the bowl
of the pipe will unite this breach; for there exists a strong cohesive
attraction between the attenuated particles of the lather; you will,
therefore, perceive that, on this account, the bubble will be more
readily and securely separated by a lateral than a perpendicular
motion of the pipe.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I wish,” said Tom, “that I could discover some method of preventing
their bursting so soon, for there is scarcely time to examine them
before they vanish. What can be the cause of their short duration?”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='206' id='Page_206'></span>“Consider, my dear boy, the frailty of their structure, and I think
that the precarious tenure of their existence will cease to astonish
you; indeed, the wonder is, that they should endure so long. The film
of which they consist is inconceivably thin,<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c017'><sup>[39]</sup></a> so that the slightest
impulse will be apt to rupture them; besides which, there must be a
considerable evaporation going on from their surface, while the
contraction of the contained air, from change of temperature, must
also tend to limit their duration. You must likewise remember that the
soap-lather will have a tendency to gravitate towards the depending
part of the bubble, and, consequently, by quitting the upper portion,
to render it of still greater tenuity. This last effect might,
perhaps, be obviated, in some measure, by giving a rotatory motion to
the bubble around its axis; but this, again, would accelerate the
evaporation: which, after all, is the principal cause of the shortness
of its duration; so that, unless this latter effect could be remedied,
I despair of suggesting any expedient by which the frail existence of
our airy structure could be protracted. You must, therefore, seek,
from a succession of bubbles, the prolongation of an amusement which
no single one can afford you.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And could not the evaporation be prevented?” asked Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“If the bubble were blown in a glass vessel, and the latter
immediately closed after the operation, it would remain for some time;
I remember having once preserved a bubble in this manner for a very
considerable period.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Tom, however, did not appear to relish this scheme; as, he said, the
great sport arose from watching the movements of the floating bubble;
the boy, accordingly, determined to pursue the amusement in the usual
manner. His father, however, observed, that
<span class='pageno' title='207' id='Page_207'></span>by mixing a solution of isinglass with the soap lather, larger, as well
as more lasting bubbles might be blown; and Tom accordingly determined
to make the experiment.</p>

<p class='c016'>During this dialogue, little John had succeeded, for the first time,
in launching the airy bauble. Imagination always tinges the objects of
our first efforts with brilliant tints: no wonder, therefore, that
John, with a shout of ecstasy, should have pronounced it to have been
the most beautiful bubble he had ever seen: in truth, the sun was
shining brightly, and the colours thus produced very justly excited
the admiration of all present.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I cannot understand the cause of these beautiful colours,” said
Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour expressed a fear that, in their present state of
knowledge, they would be scarcely able to understand the explanation
he should afford them. “But,” said he, “I believe you know that a ray
of light is divisible into seven colours, and that when it passes
through certain media, or is reflected from certain surfaces, this
division is effected, and the various colours produced<a href='#note32'>(32)</a>. The film
of the soap bubble is one amongst the latter bodies; but I must refer
you, for farther information upon this subject, to Mrs. Marcet’s
beautiful account of ‘Refraction and Colours.’”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Now, Tom,” said his father, “fetch your squirt, for we have not yet
finished our enquiry into the effects of the air’s pressure.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The squirt was produced; but it was out of repair: for, on attempting
to fill it with water, the instrument entirely failed in the
performance of its office.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I see the defect,” said Mr. Seymour, “which a little string will
easily remedy.”</p>

<p class='c016'>A piece of string was instantly produced from that universal depot,
the breeches pocket of a school-boy. Mr. Seymour said he should bind a
portion of it around the end of the piston.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='208' id='Page_208'></span>“What do you mean by the <i>piston</i>?” enquired Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The rod which moves up and down in the cylinder, or tube; and, unless
its end fit so exactly as to prevent the admission of air, it is clear
that the squirt cannot draw any water. It was for the purpose of
making this part fit tightly that I wanted the string, and you will
now perceive that the instrument is ready for use:--fetch me a vessel
of water.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Tom soon produced the water, and, on placing it on the ground,
requested that he might be allowed to fill the squirt. This he
accordingly effected without difficulty, and, on pressing down the
handle, he projected a stream of water to a considerable distance.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I perceive,” said Tom, “that the stream describes a curve, like my
ball.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“To be sure; it is under the joint influence of the same forces, viz.
that of projection and of gravity. But explain the operation of the
squirt.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“As soon as I raised the piston, an empty space was left in the lower
part of the cylinder, which I suppose would have remained as a
<i>vacuum</i>, had not the water rushed into it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And why did the water rush into it?”</p>

<p class='c016'>Tom hesitated.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Was it not, think you, owing to the pressure of the atmosphere upon
the surface of the water? When you raised the piston, the air above it
was also raised, and ultimately driven out by the force of the
ascending piston; and since the air could not find any entrance from
below as long as the point was under the water, the interior of the
squirt would necessarily have remained quite empty, or have been a
vacuum, had it not been for the weight of the atmosphere, which, not
having any counteracting pressure, drove the water into the tube, and
thus filled it; and which, by pressing down the piston, you again
expelled with considerable force.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='209' id='Page_209'></span>“Your explanation,” cried Louisa, “is so clear and intelligible, that
I feel quite confident I could now explain any machine that owes its
action to the exhaustion of the air, and the pressure of the
atmosphere.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“If that be your belief,” said Mr. Seymour, “I will not lose a moment
in putting your knowledge to the test.--Tom, do you run into the
house, and fetch hither the kitchen bellows.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The bellows were produced, and Louisa having been desired by her
father to explain the manner in which they received and expelled the
air, proceeded as follows: “Upon raising the upper from the under
board, the interior space of the bellows is necessarily increased, and
immediately supplied with an additional quantity of air, which is
driven into it by the pressure of the atmosphere; when, by pressing
down the upper board, it is again expelled through the iron tube or
nosle.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“To be sure,” said Tom, “in the same manner that the water was
expelled from my squirt, when I pushed down the handle.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“So far you are quite correct,” said Mr. Seymour; “but you have not
yet told us the use of the hole in the under-board, and which is
covered, as you perceive, with a movable flap of leather: it is termed
a valve, or ‘<i>wind-clap</i>.’”</p>

<p class='c016'>“That,” replied Tom, “is for the purpose of admitting the air, when we
raise up the board.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Exactly so; and also to prevent the air from passing out again, when
you press it down. I wish to direct your attention particularly to
this contrivance, because, simple as it may appear, its action will
teach you the general nature of a valve. Without it, the operation of
filling the bellows with air would have been so tedious as to have
destroyed the utility of the instrument; for the air could, in that
case, have only found admission through the nosle, and that, again,
<span class='pageno' title='210' id='Page_210'></span>would have been attended with the additional disadvantage of drawing smoke
and other matter into its cavity; when, however, you raise up the
board, the air, by its external pressure, opens the wind-clap inwards,
and thus finds an easy entrance for itself; and when you press the
board downwards, the air, thus condensed, completely shuts the valve,
and its return through that avenue being prevented, it rushes out
through the tube.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The children were much pleased with the simplicity of this invention,
and Tom enquired of the vicar who first thought of it.</p>

<p class='c016'>“We are informed by Strabo,” replied Mr. Twaddleton, “that Anacharsis,
the Scythian philosopher, who lived in the time of Solon, about six
hundred years before Christ, invented the bellows, as well as the
anchor, and potter’s wheel; but,” he added, “there is some reason to
doubt the truth of this statement. The bellows, however, were
certainly known to the Greeks; and the great poet Virgil alludes to
them in his fourth Georgic:<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c017'><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour now proposed that they should proceed to consider the
structure and operation of the pump.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I suppose,” said Louisa, “that the pump raises water in the same
manner as the squirt.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Exactly upon the same principle,” replied her father; “but the
machinery is a little more complicated, since its object is not to
force the water out of the pump at the same end of the pipe at which
we draw it in. We will, however, proceed to the stableyard, and
examine the pump; and do you, Tom, provide
<span class='pageno' title='211' id='Page_211'></span>a piece of chalk, in order that I may make a sketch of some of its
principal parts.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The party immediately proceeded; and, as they walked along, Mr.
Seymour desired the children to remember that the weight of the
atmosphere was estimated as being equal to that of fifteen pounds upon
every square inch of surface; and that the moment the water arrived at
such a height as to balance that pressure, it could ascend no higher:
he added, that the altitude at which such a balance took place was
about 32 or 33 feet above the surface.</p>

<p class='c016'>“If that be the case,” said Louisa, “the pump, of course, can never
raise water from any well of greater depth than that which you state.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Not without some additional contrivance, which I shall afterwards
explain to you,” replied Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>The party had, by this time, arrived at the pump; its door was opened,
and as much of the apparatus exhibited as could be conveniently
exposed. Mr. Seymour then chalked the annexed sketch upon the stable
door.</p>

<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/figp228.png' alt='Diagram of a water-pump’s mechanism.' class='c036' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>“Is that a pump?” asked Tom: “I should certainly never have guessed
what you intended to represent.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is not a perspective drawing, my dear, but a representation of the
different parts as they would appear, were it possible to cut the pump
in halves, from top to bottom, without disturbing any of its
arrangements. A drawing of this kind, which is frequently used for the
sake of explanation, is termed a <i>section</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour here took an apple from his pocket, and having cut it in
two, observed that the surfaces thus exposed presented <i>sections</i> of
the fruit. This
<span class='pageno' title='212' id='Page_212'></span>illustration was understood by all present, and Mr. Seymour continued,
“I have here, then, a section of the common household pump. <b><span class='fss'>A B</span></b> is the
cylinder or barrel; <b><span class='fss'>P</span></b> the air-tight piston which moves or works within
it, by means of the rod; <b><span class='fss'>Q</span></b> is the ‘suction,’ or ‘feeding pipe,’
descending into a well, or any other reservoir; <b><span class='fss'>S</span></b> the valve, or little
door, at the bottom of the barrel, covering the top of the feeding
pipe; and there is a similar valve in the piston, both of which,
opening upwards, admit the water to rise through them, but prevent its
returning. As this part of the apparatus is no less ingenious than it
is important, I will sketch the valve, or <i>clack</i>, as it is termed by
the engineer, on a larger scale.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Their father then chalked the annexed figure; from which its
construction was rendered perfectly intelligible to the children.</p>

<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/figp229.png' alt='Open valve.' class='c039' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour proceeded: “When the pump is in a state of inaction, the
two valves are closed by their own weight; but, on drawing up the
piston <b><span class='fss'>P</span></b>, from the bottom to the top of the barrel, the column of air,
which rested upon it, is raised, and a vacuum is produced between the
piston and the lower valve, <b><span class='fss'>S</span></b>; the air beneath this valve, which is
immediately over the surface of the water, consequently expands, and
forces its way through it; the water then ascends into the pump. A few
strokes of the handle totally exclude the air from the body of the
pump, and fill it with water: which, having passed through both
valves, runs out at the spout.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I understand how water may be thus raised to the elevation of 32
feet, but I have yet to learn the manner in which it can be raised
above that distance,” said Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is undoubtedly true that, if the distance from the surface of the
water to the valve in the piston exceed 32 feet, water can never be
forced into the barrel; but you will readily perceive that, when once
the
<span class='pageno' title='213' id='Page_213'></span>water has passed the piston valve, it is no longer the pressure of the air
which causes it to ascend; after that period, it is raised by lifting
it up, as you would raise it in a bucket, of which the piston formed
the bottom; and water, having been so raised, cannot fall back again,
in consequence of the valve, which is kept closed by its pressure.
All, therefore, that is necessary, is to keep the working barrel
within the limits of atmospheric pressure; we have then only to fix a
continued straight pipe to the top of the barrel, and to lengthen the
piston rod in the same proportion, and the water will continue to rise
at each successive stroke of the pump, until at length it will flow
over the top of the pipe, or through a spout inserted in any part of
its side. The common pump, therefore, is properly called the <i>sucking</i>
and <i>lifting pump</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The party expressed themselves fully satisfied; and Tom enquired who
invented the machine.</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is an instrument of great antiquity,” replied his father: “its
invention is generally ascribed to Ctesebes of Alexandria, who lived
about 120 years before Christ; but the principle of its action was not
understood for ages after its invention. The ancients entertained a
belief that ‘Nature <i>abhorred</i> a vacuum;’ and they imagined that, when
the piston ascended, the water immediately rushed forward to prevent
the occurrence of this much dreaded vacuum. In the seventeenth century
a pump was constructed at Florence, by which it was attempted to raise
water from a well to a very considerable altitude, but it was found
that no exertion of this machine could be made to raise it above 32
feet from its level. This unexpected embarrassment greatly puzzled the
engineer, until Galileo suggested that the pressure on the water below
must cause its ascent into the pump, and that, according to this
theory, when it had risen 32 feet, its pressure became equivalent to
that of the atmosphere, and could, therefore, not rise any higher; and
as they
<span class='pageno' title='214' id='Page_214'></span>did not, at that time, understand the construction of the piston valve,
the design was abandoned. It is now time to conclude your lesson.
To-morrow I hope we shall be able to enter upon the subject of <span class='sc'>The
Kite</span>.”</p>

<p class='c024'>The children were summoned into the library, and informed by their
father that he was at leisure to explain the philosophy of the kite; a
subject with which Tom had repeatedly expressed some impatience to
become acquainted.</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is a beautiful day,” exclaimed the boy joyously; “and there is
such a delightful breeze, that I should really call it a complete
<i>kite-day</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='216' id='Page_216'></span>“Gently, my fine fellow,” replied Mr. Seymour: “the bird must be
fledged, ere it can fly. We have not, as yet, any kite: for you know
that the one you possess is shattered beyond the possibility of
repair.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“True, papa; but could not Robert just step into the village and buy
one? I saw several kites in the shop of Peg Robson yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I do not doubt it, my boy; but the kites which are to be found in the
toy-shop are made to sell, rather than to fly; and to <i>raise the
wind</i>, for the benefit of the vender, rather than to be raised <i>by
it</i>, for the amusement of the purchaser: we must, therefore, construct
one for ourselves; and see, I have, accordingly, prepared all the
necessary materials for the purpose. I have here, as you perceive, a
straight lath of deal, about three-quarters of an inch wide, and less
than a quarter of an inch thick, and about four feet in length; this
is quite ready for forming the standard, or <i>back-bone</i> of the kite:
and now for the bow. The cooper has complied with my directions, and
sent an unbent hoop, as free as possible from knots; you observe that
it is about the same length as the lath, but it will be necessary to
pare it down a little at each end, in order to make it bend more
readily to the required shape.”</p>

<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/figp234.png' alt='Diagram of a kite.' class='c037' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>This having been accomplished, Mr. Seymour proceeded to form the
framework of the kite in the following manner. He first ascertained
the central point of the bow, by balancing it on his fore-finger; he
then affixed that point, by means of string, to the lath, at <b><i>c</i></b>,
about an inch and a half from its upper extremity; a notch was next
cut in each end of the hoop, or bow, <i>a d</i>; having fixed the string in
the notch, <b><i>a</i></b>, he drew it through another, <b><i>e</i></b>, previously cut in the
bottom of the lath, and carried it to the opposite end of the bow <b><i>d</i></b>;
the skeleton now presented the usual form, of the kite. The next
point, therefore, was to ascertain whether the two sides of the bow
were in equilibrio,
<span class='pageno' title='217' id='Page_217'></span>which he determined by balancing the lath on the finger, and observing
whether it remained horizontal, or dipped on either side. This
adjustment having been accomplished, Mr. Seymour next continued the
string from <b><i>d</i></b> across the skeleton to the opposite notch <b><i>a</i></b>, giving
it one turn round the lath in its way; from <b><i>a</i></b> it was carried to <b><i>f</i></b>,
and wound round the top of the lath, and then again fastened at <b><i>d</i></b>;
from <b><i>d</i></b> it was extended rather more than midway down the lath, and
having been secured at <b><i>b</i></b>, was finally carried to, and secured in the
notch <b><i>a</i></b>. The framework was now pronounced by Mr. Seymour to be
complete.<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c017'><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c016'>The next part of the process was to cover it with paper. Mr. Seymour
observed, that the best kind which could be employed for this purpose
was that known amongst stationers by the name of <i>fan paper</i>, so
called from its being manufactured for the use of the fanmaker; its
merits, he said, depended upon the size of its sheets, as well as upon
the thinness and firmness of its texture: this, however was not at
hand; he was therefore obliged to rest satisfied with its best
substitute, viz. folio sheets of large thin post.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='218' id='Page_218'></span>The party now went “ding-dong” to work; paper, paste, and scissors
were immediately put in requisition. Sheets of paper were laid smooth
on the table, and so arranged that each sheet overlapped its neighbour
about half an inch. The skeleton of the kite was then placed upon
them, and the paper was cut to its figure; a margin, of about
three-quarters of an inch, having been left around it, except over the
bow, where the margin was extended to an inch in width: this
arrangement was for the purpose of allowing the paper to turn over the
framework, when pasted to it. This part of the work having been
completed, and a sufficient time allowed for the drying of the paste,
Mr. Seymour proceeded to fix the string, usually termed the
<i>belly-band</i>: for this purpose two holes were drilled through the
lath, at equal distances from its edges; the upper one about a fifth
part of the length of the kite from the top, the lower hole rather
more than the same distance above its extremity.</p>

<p class='c016'>The last, and by far the most important point, was to make the loop in
the <i>belly-band</i>. If the kite be accurately constructed, its proper
place may be easily found by extending the band, right or left, on the
surface of the kite, and then marking the string at a point which lies
in a line drawn from one end of the bow to the other; the loop must be
made a little above such a point. If the kite be now suspended by this
loop, the two ends of the bow ought to preserve a balance, and the
lower extremity should dip below the upper part of the kite.</p>

<p class='c016'>As Louisa observed the extreme care with which her father adjusted
this part of the machine, she enquired into its use.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I was myself about to put the same question,” said her mother; “for
its adjustment would appear to require as much accuracy as that of the
sash of a girl of sixteen.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='219' id='Page_219'></span>Mr. Seymour informed them, they would hereafter find that the steady
ascent of the kite into the air entirely depended upon such accuracy.
“Have you not seen, Tom,” asked he, “a kite rise sideways, or
<i>plunge</i>, as it is called?”</p>

<p class='c016'>Tom said he had often experienced that difficulty at school, but that
he had attributed it to some defect in the tail.</p>

<p class='c016'>“An error in the construction of the tail may, certainly, be
occasionally the cause of such an accident, but it is more generally
referable to an improper position of the loop: if the kite <i>plunges</i>,
you may conclude that this loop is placed too high; and should it
whirl round in the air, you may infer that it is too low.”</p>

<p class='c016'>During this conversation Mr. Twaddleton entered the apartment; Tom was
anxious to show him his newly-constructed kite, and, while the party
were asking him numerous questions, Mr. Seymour observed, that the
vicar would be more profitably employed in making <i>bobs</i> for the
string of the tail, than in finding answers for their string of
questions.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mrs. Seymour, and her daughters, with Tom and the vicar, were,
accordingly, placed round the table, for the purpose of carrying this
project into effect, by a suitable division of labour. It was arranged
that Mrs. Seymour should cut the paper, the vicar fold it, and Mr.
Seymour tie it on the string.</p>

<p class='c016'>“How long ought the tail to be?” asked Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“And of what shape should the papers be cut?” enquired Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“And at what distances are they to be placed from each other on the
string?” said Mrs. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I will answer all your queries,” replied the father, “by giving you a
dissertation upon this part of our machine.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“We shall now have an harangue,” exclaimed the vicar, “as long as the
tail itself; but pray proceed.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='220' id='Page_220'></span>“The tail should never be less than twelve, and should it even amount
to twenty times the length of the kite, its appearance in the air will
be more graceful; this, however, must be regulated by the weight of
the string, and by the length and thickness of the pieces of paper of
which the tail is composed. The length of each ought to be about three
inches and a quarter, and an inch and a half in breadth, and it should
be folded four times longitudinally; each of these <i>bobs</i>, as they are
called, must be placed at regular intervals of three inches.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And with respect to the size of the wings?” asked the vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I should not recommend any wings; if the kite be well made, there
cannot be any advantage from such appendages. Having now answered your
several questions, let us proceed with our work.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“But where is the paper?” asked Mrs. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Apropos,” answered her husband; “the box in which the London toys
were packed contains a quantity that will answer our purpose.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The box was accordingly placed on the table.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Why, what a most extraordinary miscellany!” cried the vicar; “the
army of Mithridates could not have consisted of a more incongruous
mixture. I perceive,” added he, as his enquiring eyes glanced from
sheet to sheet, “we have here a fragment of almost every description
of literary and scientific work.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The market,” observed Mr. Seymour, “is supplied with waste paper from
the catacombs of Paternoster Row, which may be truly said to ‘level
all distinctions.’ Without intending any offence by a pun, my good
vicar, what a <i>tale</i> will this box unfold! I never open a magazine of
this waste paper, without feeling a deep sympathy for the melancholy
fate of authors: to see the strange transmigrations, and vile
purposes, to which their works are destined, is really heart-rending.
That the <i>lights</i> of science should be
<span class='pageno' title='221' id='Page_221'></span>consigned to the tallow-chandler! the works of the moralist, so well
calculated to <i>purify</i> the world, to the soap-seller! that such a book
as ‘Laennec on the <i>Chest</i>,’ with Dr. Forbes’s valuable <i>Cases</i> in the
bargain, should be <i>packed</i> off to the <i>trunk</i>-maker! are events which
cannot fail to furnish food for melancholy reflection. Nay, more, I
have myself (can you believe it, Mr. Twaddleton?) actually received a
quantity of <i>ureic</i> acid in a Review of Dr. Thomson’s Chemistry! and I
only yesterday learned, with horror, that a piece of fat bacon was
positively wrapped up in a page of ‘Paris on Diet;’ while a Cheshire
cheese came encased in Kitchener’s ‘Chart of the Moon.’”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Oh, shameful! shameful!!” exclaimed the vicar: “but I can assure you,
that this unfeeling conduct of the publisher had not escaped my notice
and indignation; for I lately received a work against the slave-trade,
in the fragment of a tract on ‘the Progress of Cant;’ and a Copy of
Irving’s Orations, in an act of ‘Much Ado about Nothing;’ and what was
still worse,” continued the reverend divine, “a little work on the art
of Prognosticating the Weather, was forwarded to me in a chapter of
<i>Daniel’s</i> Prophecies.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“But let us quit these melancholy reflections for the present, and
proceed with our occupation.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“If you compose the tail of your kite with these papers,” said the
vicar, “it will certainly vie with that of Scriblerus himself; you
will have a knot of divinity,--a knot of physic,--a knot of logic,--a
knot of philosophy,--a knot of poetry,--and a knot of history.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Never mind, my dear sir; I wager an edition of Virgil, that I shall
be able to discover in each page, with which you may present me, some
apposite allusion to the <i>tail</i>, of which it is to form a part.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Apposite allusion! impossible; as well might
<span class='pageno' title='222' id='Page_222'></span>you attempt to connect the scattered leaves of the Sibyl: for example,
here is an Epitome of the Roman History.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Very well,” said Mr. Seymour, “and pray is not that cur<i>tail</i>?”</p>

<p class='c016'>The vicar dropped the paper in dismay; the treacherous design of his
friend now, for the first time, flashed across his brain with a
painful conviction, and he hastily retreated to a distant corner of
the library, or “<i>turned tail</i>,” as Mr. Seymour jocosely expressed it,
in order that he might find shelter from the pelting of a pitiless
storm of puns, which he saw, too clearly, was about to burst on his
devoted head.</p>

<p class='c016'>On the vicar’s retiring from the table, Mrs. Seymour approached the
fatal box, observing, “that it was now her turn to explore the
Sibylline cave.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Here,” said she, “is a list of the prices of some newly published
works.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“That,” replied her husband, as he cast a sly glance at the vicar, “is
re<i>tail</i>: pray, proceed.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“We have next, I perceive, a prospectus for publishing all the
speeches in the late parliament.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“That is de<i>tail</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Here a deep groan from Mr. Twaddleton arrested the progress of the
proceedings, and threw the whole party into a fit of laughter. As soon
as tranquillity was restored, Mrs. Seymour again dipped her hand into
the box, and drew forth the fragments of a work on Real Property.</p>

<p class='c016'>“That,” said Mr. Seymour, “is en<i>tail</i>; pray, <i>cut it off</i>, and give
it to me.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“We have here,” continued the lady, “the Memoirs of an Italian
Bandit.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Then prepare him for his fate; I have a noose quite ready for his
reception.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Here is a poem, entitled Waterloo.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I will patronise it,” said her husband; “and I warrant you that,
under my auspices, the muse will
<span class='pageno' title='223' id='Page_223'></span>soar to a greater height than she ever could otherwise have attained.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“We have here, I declare, a part of * * * * [sic] pamphlet.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Then I have lost my wager,” exclaimed Mr. Seymour, “for I defy the
power of man to make either head or <i>tail</i> of it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Thus did Mr. and Mrs. Seymour proceed; the one cutting paper, the
other cutting jokes; nor did the former cease stringing puns, until he
had finished stringing the tail.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I must now conclude by making a knot that shall not be in danger of
becoming untied in the breeze,” said Mr. Seymour: “but stop, stop one
moment! I still require one more piece of paper to complete my task,
and let it be double.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Here then is a piece of paper, which, from its texture, appears to be
well adapted to your purpose. Let me see, what is it? I declare it is
the titlepage of an Essay on Matrimony.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Capital!” cried her husband; “a strange coincidence, truly; you have,
indeed, furnished me with a knot that cannot be easily untied, however
stiff may be the breeze; hand it over to me, for it will afford a very
legitimate finish, and is generally the conclusion of every <i>tale</i>:
but where is the vicar? What, ho! Mr. Twaddleton.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The reverend gentleman had so contrived to conceal his person in the
corner of the room, behind a large folio which he had placed on a desk
before him, that several moments elapsed before he was discovered; at
length, however, a long-drawn sigh betrayed him in his retreat.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Upon my word,” exclaimed he, as he pushed aside the huge folio, “your
volatility, Mr. Seymour, is wholly inconsistent with the gravity of a
scientific instructor.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“But, at present,” replied Mr. Seymour, “I am
<span class='pageno' title='224' id='Page_224'></span>the manufacturer of a kite’s tail; and, surely, upon such an occasion,
<i>flightiness</i> ought not to be urged to my disparagement.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The party, shortly after this discussion, separated: Mr. Seymour
retired to his own room; the vicar proceeded to the church to bury a
patient of Doseall’s; and the children ran into the garden to enjoy
their rural sports.</p>

<p class='c016'>On the following day, before the wings of the lark had brushed away
the morning dew, Tom and his sisters, buoyant with expectation, had
descended into the garden, in order to ascertain the state of the
weather and the direction of the wind; but the sky was sullen and
calm, not a breath disturbed the susceptible leaves of the aspen; all
was repose--“a dread repose.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“No kite-day this,” sighed Tom, with a countenance as lowering as the
morning clouds.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Have patience,” said Louisa; “the wind may yet rise, it is only just
six o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Thus did the minds of the children continue to hover between hope and
despair, until after breakfast, when they determined to seek the
gardener, and hold a grave consultation with that acknowledged judge
of the elements; he told them that showers might be expected, but he
thought it probable that the wind might rise after mid-day. “I will,
however,” said he, “consult my oracles;<a href='#note33'>(33)</a> after which, I shall be
able to give you a satisfactory opinion.” So saying, he left them;
and, on his return, observed that “as the <i>Siberian sow-thistle</i> had
closed itself the preceding evening, and the <i>African marigold</i>
continued shut after seven o’clock in the morning, he had thought
there would be rain; but,” he added, “that upon inspecting the
<i>poor-man’s weatherglass</i>, the <i>Anagallis arvensis</i>, or <i>red
pimpernel</i>, two hours ago, he had found it open, from which he
concluded that the day would have been fine.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“There, Louisa; it will be a fine day, after all,” exclaimed her
delighted brother.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='225' id='Page_225'></span>“No, indeed,” continued the gardener; “on returning just now to the
flower, which never deceives us, I found it had closed itself, so that
rain is inevitable.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Nor was this opinion erroneous; for before the brother and sister
could reach the lodge, the heavy clouds began to discharge their
watery burthen, and the rain continued in one incessant shower for
more than two hours; it then gradually abated, and the children, who
had been anxiously watching it at the library window, were suddenly
relieved from their anxiety by the appearance of the vicar, whom they
espied slowly winding his way through the dripping shrubbery.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

    <div>“<b>‘Heu! quianam tanti cinxerunt æthera nimbi?’</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>as Virgil has it,” exclaimed the vicar, as he approached the portico,
where Mr. Seymour and his family had assembled to salute him.</p>

<p class='c016'>“We are under the influence of St. Swithin, vicar,” said Mrs. Seymour,
“and I fear there is but slender hope of its becoming fair.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Psha! who cares for St. Swithin?<a href='#note34'>(34)</a> My barometer is rising rapidly,
and I place more confidence in that classical deity, Mercury, than in
a saint of so very questionable a character.”</p>

<p class='c016'>At this moment, Phœbus, as if delighted by the compliment thus
bestowed upon his heathen brother, cast a sly glance from behind a
dark cloud, and illumined the spot upon which the vicar was standing.
In short, after the lapse of half an hour, the sun broke through the
gloom, and a brisk gale followed; the countenances of the children
sympathised with the face of the heavens, and the expression of hope
lighted them up, in proportion as the sun illumined the departing
clouds with its radiance.</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is now quite fair, papa,” cried Tom, in a voice of triumph, “and
there is a most delightful wind; shall we not proceed at once to the
common?”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='226' id='Page_226'></span>“Presently,” answered his father: “the ground is yet extremely wet.”</p>

<p class='c016'>In the course of an hour this objection had been removed, and the
party prepared to set off on their kite-flying expedition.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Bring me the kite, and let me sling it properly over Tom’s shoulder,”
said Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I will carry the string,” exclaimed Louisa; “how nicely it is wound
round the stick.”</p>

<p class='c016'>As the party walked forwards, the vicar asked Tom whether he knew from
whence the name of the <i>kite</i> originated.</p>

<p class='c016'>“A kite is a bird of prey,” answered the boy, “which soars a great
height; and from remaining stationary in the air, was, I suppose,
thought to resemble the paper kite.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“That is a very good explanation,” said the vicar; “or it may,
perhaps, have derived its name from the circumstance of its having
been originally constructed in the shape of a bird of this
description. In China the flying of kites is much more practised than
in this country; and I understand that their shape is always that of
some bird.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“In the London toy-shops you may constantly meet with them in such
forms, as well as in many other fantastic shapes,” observed Mr.
Seymour; “and,” continued he, “I remember to have seen, some years
ago, a kite which resembled a man. It was made of linen cloth, cut,
and painted for the purpose, and stretched on a light frame, so
constructed as to resemble the outline of the human figure. It stood
upright, and was dressed in a sort of jacket. Its arms were disposed
like handles on each side of its body, and its head being covered with
a cap, terminating in an angle, favoured the ascent of the machine,
which was twelve feet in height; but to render it easier to be
transported, it could be folded double, by means of hinges adapted to
the frame. The person who directed
<span class='pageno' title='227' id='Page_227'></span>this kind of kite was able to raise it, though the weather was calm, to the
height of nearly five hundred feet; and, when once raised, he
maintained it in the air by giving only a slight motion to the string.
The figure, by these means, acquired a kind of libration, like that of
a man skaiting on the ice. The illusion, occasioned by this spectacle,
did not fail, as you may readily suppose, to attract a great number of
spectators.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I believe, however,” observed the vicar, “that the figure commonly
adopted, is the one best calculated for the purpose.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Undoubtedly,” replied Mr. Seymour, “and for obvious reasons; the
curvature of the bow enables it to escape the resistance of the air,
as it rises; which, after having struck it, slides off, just as the
current is more effectually turned aside by the gently curved prow,
than by that which has a sharp outline; for the same reason, the mast
of a ship, though it has a conical shape, is more easily drawn through
the water with its broad, than with its narrow end, foremost; for
although the primary obstruction is, no doubt, greater in the former
case, yet the water heaped, as it were, on the front, is made to
stream off with a slight divergency, and therefore does not hang on
the sides of the mast, as it would in the latter case. This shape of
the kite, moreover, presents the largest surface at the point upon
which the wind can act with the greatest effect, while the whole is
lightened by the removal of parts that would obstruct its action. The
tail has also a greater control over a figure of such a description.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour asked the vicar, “whether he could explain the origin of
the French term for the kite, viz. <i>cerf volant</i>, or flying stag; I
never can believe,” continued he, “that the kite could ever have been
constructed in the shape of that animal.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I am unable to clear up the difficulty,” replied
<span class='pageno' title='228' id='Page_228'></span>the vicar; “and yet I have taken some pains upon the subject. The earliest
notice of the kite, which I have been able to discover, is in a short
English and French Dictionary, by Miege, which was published in the
year 1690, and it is there described under the name of <i>cerf volant</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I wonder,” cried Tom, “who invented the kite?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“In, that, again,” answered Mr. Twaddleton, “I am unable to furnish
you with any satisfactory information. The pastime appears to be of
very ancient date in China, and was, probably, first imported into
Europe from that country.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“At what period, do you suppose?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Strutt, who was very assiduous and correct in all his antiquarian
researches, was of opinion that its introduction into England could
not be dated farther back than a hundred and fifty years.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The party had, by this time, reached Overton heath; the weather was
favourable; and the kite impatiently fluttered in the breeze, while
Tom was eagerly engaged in unwinding its streaming tail, and preparing
the paper machine for ascent.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Is the string fixed to the belly-band?” asked Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“All is ready,” replied the vicar; “and I will hold it up, while Tom
runs with it against the wind. Had King Eric set his cap for us, we
could not have had a more favourable breeze.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“There is not the least occasion to raise the kite from the ground,”
observed Mr. Seymour; “let its point rest on the grass, and place its
tail in a straight line in front of it; I warrant you it will rise, as
soon as Tom begins to run.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Tom immediately set off, and the kite rose majestically into the air.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Give it string--give it string--gently, gently--now stop; there is no
occasion for your running any farther but let out the cord, as long as
the kite
<span class='pageno' title='229' id='Page_229'></span>carries it off vigorously, and keeps it fully stretched; but wind it
up the moment its tension is relaxed.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is rising very fast,” cried the breathless boy, “but the string
burns my hand as it passes through it; I shall not be able to endure
the heat.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Be patient, and let it pass more slowly; put on your glove,” said his
father.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Ay, ay; put on your glove,” repeated the vicar; “even Xenophon
himself, who declaimed so warmly against the effeminacy of the
Persians, for wearing gloves, would scarcely have refused his consent
to their use on such an occasion.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“What is it that produces so much heat?” enquired Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The friction of the string,” replied her father.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Do you not know that carriages frequently catch fire from the
friction of their wheels, unless it be prevented by the application of
grease?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Yes,” said Tom; “and I have heard that the natives of some countries
kindle their fires by rubbing pieces of wood together.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The original inhabitants of the new world,” observed his father,
“throughout the whole extent from Patagonia to Greenland, procured
fire by rubbing pieces of hard and dry wood against each other, until
they emitted sparks, or burst into flame; some of the people to the
north of California produced the same effect by inserting a kind of
pivot in the hole of a very thick plank, and causing it to revolve
with extreme rapidity: the same principle will explain how immense
forests can have been consumed; for it is evident, that the violent
friction of the branches against each other, from the agitation of the
wind, would be fully adequate to the production of such an effect.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You have also an excellent example of the effect of friction in
producing heat,” said the vicar, “in the history of the whale fishery;
for, in harpooning the fish, unless the sailors observe the greatest
caution in
<span class='pageno' title='230' id='Page_230'></span>letting out the rope, its friction upon the side of their boat will be
sure to set it on fire.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And how do they manage it?” asked Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“As soon as the whale dives,<a href='#note35'>(35)</a> after having been wounded, it draws
out the line or cord of the harpoon, which is coiled up in the boat,
with very considerable velocity. In order, therefore, to prevent any
accident from the violence of this motion, one man is stationed with
an axe to cut it asunder, if it should become entangled; while
another, with a mop, is constantly cooling with water the channel
through which it passes.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The kite is now at a considerable height,” observed Tom; “but look at
the string, how bent it is! I have repeatedly endeavoured to pull it
straight, but without success.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“How could you have expected to succeed in the attempt? Consider the
weight of such a long line of string.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Then it is not the pressure of the atmosphere which gives it that
curved form?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Assuredly not: have you so soon forgotten that the air presses
equally in all directions, and would therefore tend to straighten, as
much as to give a curved direction to the string? But, as you now
appear to have let out the whole of your string, suppose you allow the
kite to enjoy its airing, while we proceed to consider the philosophy
of its ascent, and the nature and direction of those forces by which
it is effected.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The kite pulls so amazingly hard,” cried Tom, “that unless I fix the
string securely around the tree, we shall run the chance of losing
it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I am well aware of the force it exerts,” replied his father. “Dr.
Franklin has said, that, with a good kite, a man unable to swim might
be sustained in the water, so as to pass from Dover to Calais; but I
agree with him in thinking, that a packet would
<span class='pageno' title='231' id='Page_231'></span>be a much safer, as well as a pleasanter mode of conveyance.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Now, then, for your explanation of the kite’s ascent. Unless I am
mistaken, you will find the subject much more complicated than you
imagine,” said the vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Not at all; Tom, who, I trust, has a perfect acquaintance with the
composition and resolution of forces, will very readily understand the
explanation I propose to offer. I admit, however, that there are some
few points in the enquiry, which cannot be successfully treated
without a knowledge of the higher branches of the mathematics; but I
shall, of course, avoid all such difficulties.<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c017'><sup>[42]</sup></a> Can you tell me,
Tom, what advantage is gained by your running with the kite?” asked
Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I suppose that you thus obtain more force from the wind.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Certainly: action and reaction are equal. By running, therefore, with
your kite against the wind, you strike the air, and thus produce a
reaction, which is equal to the force of the blow given to it. When
the wind is high, and its action is not intercepted by surrounding
objects, there cannot exist any necessity for such an expedient.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The principle is the same as that which enables the bird to rise into
the air by flapping its wings,” observed the vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Unquestionably,” replied Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Does the kite, then, rise in the air, from the same causes that
enable a bird to fly?” asked Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“We are not, at present, considering the ascent of the kite, but the
advantage which is obtained by running with it: this latter, as the
vicar has properly
<span class='pageno' title='232' id='Page_232'></span>observed, undoubtedly depends upon the same principle as that which
enables the bird to rise, by the motion of its wings, and which
constitutes the third law of motion,<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c017'><sup>[43]</sup></a> viz. that <i>action and
reaction are equal</i>; that is to say, whenever one body exerts a force
upon another, the second body opposes the first, with equal force, in
an opposite direction. If, then, the bird strikes the air below it
with a force which is equal to its weight, then must there be a
reaction of the air, upwards, exactly equal to it; and the bird, being
acted upon by two equal forces, in opposite directions, will,
necessarily, rest between them.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“That is clear enough; but the bird <i>rises</i>,” answered Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Because the force of the stroke is <i>greater</i> than the weight of the
bird, and it therefore rises with the <i>difference</i> of these two
forces; were the stroke <i>less</i> than its weight, then would it sink
with the difference. Suppose, for example, a bird weighs <i>twelve</i>
ounces, and it strikes the air with a force equal to <i>sixteen</i>, is it
not clear that it must rise with a force equal to <i>four</i>? and is it
not evident that, if it strikes the air with a force equal only to
<i>eight</i>, that it must sink with a force equal to <i>four</i>?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“So far I understand it perfectly; but I was thinking that, as the
wing flaps up and down, what was gained by striking the air downwards
must be counterbalanced when the bird raised her wing again, and thus
struck the air in the contrary direction,” observed Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I give you no small degree of credit for that remark,” said his
father; “for it is undoubtedly true that, if the flapping of the wings
in flight were no more than the motion of the same surface upwards and
downwards, the bird must lose as much by one motion as she could gain
by the other; the skylark could never ascend by such an action, for,
as you have
<span class='pageno' title='233' id='Page_233'></span>so justly remarked, although the stroke upon the air by the under side of
her wing would carry her up, the stroke from the upper side, when she
raised her wing again, would bring her down; but, if you will
attentively examine the structure of the wing, you will at once
perceive, from its external convexity, the disposition, and more
particularly the overlapping of its larger feathers, that when the
wing is drawn up, its surface is contracted, and when let down fully
expanded--or, in other words, that the feathers strike the air
downwards with their flat side, but rise from the stroke slantwise,
just as the rower in a boat, after having given the stroke, turns his
oar so as only to present its edge, an operation which is termed
<i>feathering</i>, from its resemblance to this very action of the wing in
flight.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It appears to me that flying is an easy process,” said Tom; “could we
not contrive some sort of flapper, by which we might be able to rise
into the air?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Your opinion, my dear boy, is by no means singular; hundreds have
entertained the same belief before you; and so confident was the
famous Bishop Wilkins, that he declared it to be his conviction, that,
in future ages, it will be as usual to hear a man call for his wings,
as it is now to call for his boots.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Yes,” said the vicar; “and if my memory is correct, William of
Malmesbury, in his account of the Conquest of England by the Normans,
mentions a Benedictine monk, by the name of Elmer, who having affixed
wings to his hands and feet, ascended a lofty tower whence he took his
flight, but he fell to the ground and broke both his legs.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I do not see the difficulty,” exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The weight of our bodies is so great, that we have not sufficient
muscular strength to impart a blow to the air that shall be equal to
it. Now are you satisfied?” said his father.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='234' id='Page_234'></span>“I am perfectly satisfied, if that be the case, that we can never hope
to fly.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The principle, however, which I have just explained,” observed Mr.
Seymour, “although it will fail us in our attempts to construct wings,
is nevertheless extensively applicable in mechanics. A vane or fly,
for instance, by resisting the air as it spins round, becomes the
regulator of machinery. The intervals between the strokes on the bell
of a clock are thus regulated, and the fly, on this occasion, is so
contrived that this interval may be altered, or the clock made to
strike faster or slower, by presenting the arms of it more or less
obliquely to the direction in which they move. The same kind of fly is
the regulator used in musical boxes, as I will presently show you, and
indeed in almost all mechanical toys. Let us now return to the subject
of the kite; for, as yet, we have merely considered the effect of
increasing the wind upon its surface; we have next to enquire how the
wind operates in raising it into the air.--Do you not remember, when I
adjusted the noose in the belly-band, I stated that much depended upon
this part of the apparatus? You will, at once, perceive that it will
influence the angle which the kite forms with the earth, and I am
about to prove to you, that the theory of the kite’s ascent is
materially connected with the value of this angle; but, in order to
render my explanation intelligible, I have prepared a diagram, to
which I am desirous of directing your attention.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id024'>
<img src='images/figp251.png' alt='Diagram of a kite labeled with A, B, O, S, T, W, and Y.' class='ig024' />
</div>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='235' id='Page_235'></span>“The kite here appears in the act of rising from the ground; the line
<b><span class='fss'>W</span></b> will represent the direction of the wind blowing upon it, all the
currents of which we will suppose united in one; it is evident, from
what has been already stated, that as it falls upon an oblique
surface, it will be resolved into two forces, viz. into one parallel
with it, and into another perpendicular to that surface; of which the
force represented by the line <b><span class='fss'>Y</span></b> will alone produce any effect,
carrying the kite along the line <b><span class='fss'>O A</span></b>, or in a direction parallel to
itself; and you must have observed that this was the direction in
which the kite was impelled, when you suffered it to rise, without
checking its progress by the string.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I remember that well,” said Tom; “and I also observed that, when I
pulled my string, the kite immediately rose more perpendicularly.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“To be sure it did; because, by that operation, you called a new force
into action; which I have represented in the diagram by the line <b><span class='fss'>S T</span></b>.
The kite was therefore under the influence of the two forces <b><span class='fss'>O A</span></b> and <b><span class='fss'>S T</span></b>,
and, since these are in the direction of the two sides of a
parallelogram, it would not obey either, but ascend through <b><span class='fss'>O B</span></b>, its
diagonal.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Notwithstanding Mr. Twaddleton’s doubts upon the subject,” said Tom,
“I am sure that I perfectly understand your explanation; and I think I
may also answer for my sister: but you have not yet told us any thing
about the tail; I suppose, however, that it acts like the rudder of a
ship, or the tail of a bird.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Before I answer that question, let me inform you how the tail of a
bird differs, in its action and uses, from the rudder of a ship. In
the first place, the rudder is so fixed that it can but move in one
horizontal plane, and can therefore only turn the vessel to the right
or left, which, indeed, is all that is required;<a href='#note36'>(36)</a> but the tail of
the bird, in addition to
<span class='pageno' title='236' id='Page_236'></span>this motion, can be placed in a diagonal direction, and when expanded will
offer a considerable surface to the air, so as to fulfil some of the
offices of a third wing. Have you never watched the manœuvres of
the rook, as he gambols through the air? After flying in the ordinary
way, you will observe his wings at rest, and that he glides along
apparently without the least exertion in his descent. In this case,
his expanded wings act as a parachute; then, again, you will observe
him wheeling round, a manœuvre which is partly produced by the
oblique position of his tail, and which is readily explained upon the
principle of the resolution of forces I have just described with
reference to the action of the wind upon the surface of the kite.<a href='#note37'>(37)</a>
I ought also to state, that the tail serves to poise the body of the
bird.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Does the bird, then, never use its wings for the purpose of directing
its course?” asked Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Undoubtedly it does,” answered her father; “the tail is only to be
considered as a supplementary organ: it is by means of the wings that
it generally directs its course, for it is evident, that it can easily
turn, either to the right or left, by flapping the opposite wing with
increased force, just as a boat is turned about to the right, by a
brisk application of the left oar. In like manner the irregular flight
of the butterfly, now up and now down, now to the right and now to the
left, is no doubt effected by the wings striking the air one after the
other, or perhaps with an alternate and unequal force. The object of
such an action is obviously to baffle the pursuit of birds which fly
in a right line, whereas you see the butterfly does just the
contrary.”<a href='#note38'>(38)</a></p>

<p class='c016'>“How very wonderful,” said Louisa, “is the action of the wings of
insects. I have often watched them during their flight, and their
rapidity is such as to surpass the power of vision.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I shall have occasion to advert to that subject
<span class='pageno' title='237' id='Page_237'></span>hereafter,” said Mr. Seymour; “at present, I shall only observe, that a gnat’s
wing, in its ordinary flight, beats many hundred times in a second.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“But you have not yet answered Tom’s question,” said the vicar. “Of
what use is the tail of the kite? Does it assist its ascent, or is it
merely an appendage of ornament?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“In the first place, it keeps the head of the kite to the wind; and in
the next, it lowers its centre of gravity, and throws it towards its
extremity, which not only prevents the chance of the machine being
upset in the air, but so poises and regulates the position of the kite
as to maintain the angle which it is necessary for the string to make
with the surface.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Twaddleton here enquired what might be the most advantageous angle
for the kite to form with the horizon, in order that the paper machine
should rise to the greatest altitude.</p>

<p class='c016'>“If the wind be horizontal,” answered Mr. Seymour, “it is evident that
the inclination of the kite’s surface ought to be the same as that
which the rudder of a ship should make with the keel, in order that
the vessel may be turned with the greatest facility; supposing the
currents of water, which impel it, to have a direction parallel to the
keel.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And what ought that angle to be?” enquired the vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>“<i>Fifty-four</i> degrees, and <i>forty-four</i> minutes,” replied Mr. Seymour;
“and let me here remark,” continued he, “as we have already considered
the philosophy of the flight of a bird, that its pinions are so set
upon the body as to bring down the wings in an <i>oblique</i> direction
towards the tail; so that in their action upon the air, we have the
same resolution of forces as in that of the wind upon the surface of
the kite, by which the body of the bird is not only supported, or
raised perpendicularly, but carried forward.”<a href='#note39'>(39)</a></p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='238' id='Page_238'></span>Tom here interrupted the dialogue, by expressing a regret that he
should have been provided with so small a quantity of cord.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I do not believe, my dear boy, that any advantage could be gained by
an additional quantity of string,” said his father.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Is there, then, any reason why the kite should not ascend, even above
the clouds, provided that my string were sufficiently long and
strong?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Yes; indeed is there a most unanswerable reason. Remember that the
kite is made to rise by the operation of two forces; the one afforded
by the wind, the other by the action of the string; now it is quite
evident that, when the weight of the string, added to that of the kite
itself, becomes equal to the force of the wind, acting upon the
surface of the machine, a general balance, or equilibrium, of forces
will be established, and the kite can no longer continue to ascend.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Will it, then, remain stationary under these circumstances?” asked
Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“It must do so, unless the force of the wind should abate; for it is a
proposition in mechanics, which I shall hereafter endeavour to
demonstrate<a href='#note40'>(40)</a>, that, if a body be acted upon by three forces, which
are proportional to, and in the direction of, the three sides of a
triangle, it will be kept at rest. The kite is exactly in this
predicament, for its weight, the force of the wind, and the action of
the string, fulfil these conditions, and consequently keep the kite
stationary.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Then I must give up my intention of trying to raise the kite above
the clouds,” said Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Although you may not be able to raise any single kite to the altitude
you may desire, it is easy to accomplish your plan by a series of
kites; the string of the first being attached to the back of the
second, and so on.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“How, papa? I do not exactly understand you.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='239' id='Page_239'></span>“Your kite,” said Mr. Seymour, “is now as high in the air, as the
force of the wind is capable of raising it; suppose you were to fix
the end of the string you hold in your hand to the back of another
kite, would not this second kite ascend as high as your first, by the
same force, and your first kite therefore rise to double the altitude
it is at present. In like manner you might attach a third kite, and so
on.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Now I comprehend it; and I should much like to try the experiment,”
said Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You shall certainly witness the effect I have described; but you must
provide yourself with some stout string, for the force which the kites
exert when thus arranged, is greater than you can easily imagine;
indeed I question whether you would be able to hold them,” observed
his father.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Twaddleton here informed the young party that he had himself
witnessed a carriage containing three persons that had been drawn
along the road by kites, at the rates from fifteen to twenty miles an
hour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I have seen the account of it,” said Mr. Seymour, “and if I remember
right, the principal kite was preceded at the distance of about 120
feet by a smaller pilot one, which served to direct it away from any
obstacles, such as trees, houses, &amp;c. with which it might otherwise
have come in contact.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“But how was the pilot kite made obedient to the will of the driver?”
asked Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“By means of strings so attached to it that its surface was easily
made to alter its angular position,” answered Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“If my twine should snap,” said Tom, whose attention was suddenly
drawn to his kite from a slight unsteadiness in its motion, arising
from a gust of wind, “we could easily recover it, that is one good
thing; for it is hovering over the open field at the end of the
heath.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='240' id='Page_240'></span></p>
<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/figp257.png' alt='Diagram showing arc of fall trajectory.' class='c042' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>“If you imagine that the kite, under such circumstances, would fall
upon the spot directly under it, you are much deceived: recollect
that, if the string should snap, the kite would be abandoned to two
forces, those of the wind, and its own gravity; and you will perceive
that, under such circumstances, it could not obey either of them, but
would fall in an intermediate or diagonal direction. This fact will be
rendered apparent by the annexed diagram. <b><span class='fss'>B A</span></b> may be supposed to
represent the force and direction of the wind acting upon the kite,
and <b><span class='fss'>B D</span></b> those of its gravity; then it is evident that, under the
influence of these joint forces, it would describe the diagonal, and,
for reasons already explained, that line must necessarily be the
<i>curve</i> <b><span class='fss'>B F</span></b>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Come,” said the vicar, “before Tom draws down his kite, let us send
up a <i>messenger</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“What may that be?” asked Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“A piece of paper or pasteboard, which, on being introduced upon the
string, is blown along the line up to the kite.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The <i>messenger</i> was accordingly prepared, and being placed upon the
string, it ascended as Mr. Seymour had anticipated. While this
operation was in progress, the vicar stood earnestly gazing upon the
kite, and, at length, burst forth in the following animated
soliloquy:--</p>

<p class='c016'>“Assuredly, this must be acknowledged as a most beautiful and imposing
toy! Fastidious or insensible must be that person, who does not feel
exhilarated as he gazes on the kite, proudly floating under the canopy
of heaven, and reflecting the departing smiles
<span class='pageno' title='241' id='Page_241'></span>of the evening sun, after it has ceased to cheer us below.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It has been said,” observed Mr. Seymour, “to the disparagement of
kite-flying, that as soon as the machine has been raised into the air,
and all the string let out, the excitement of the sport is at an end,
and that as nothing further can be achieved, the interest of the
performer from that moment begins to languish; now at this period the
<i>messenger</i> will open a new source of pleasure and instruction, and
may, by a little ingenuity, be made to afford a great diversity of
amusement. I have therefore provided myself with several varieties of
this machine. Here is one in the form of a dragon, which, as it
ascends, produces a very striking and almost magical effect. See,
there it goes!”</p>

<p class='c016'>The children were delighted, for the string upon which it was carried
became at a certain height invisible; so that the figure appeared like
a monster hovering in the air.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I will now show you a <i>winged</i> variety of this apparatus, which we
will name the <i>Brompton Messenger</i>.<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c017'><sup>[44]</sup></a> It consists of a hollow
cylinder of stiff pasteboard, or thin wood, the diameter of which is
sufficiently large to allow its free revolution round the string of
the kite. To this cylinder are attached several flappers, or sails, in
an oblique direction, like those of a windmill, each of which is
covered with paper of a different colour. The action of the wind upon
those oblique surfaces necessarily occasions a rapid rotation, upon a
principle which I shall presently explain; and the beautiful effect
thus produced, as the whirling body ascends, must be seen before it
can be appreciated. I have some other contrivances of a similar
nature, which it is my intention to prepare for your future
amusement.”<a href='#note41'>(41)</a></p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='242' id='Page_242'></span>“Has the kite ever been applied to any useful purposes?” asked Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Certainly,” answered his father. “It was by means of the kite that
Dr. Franklin was enabled to demonstrate the identity of electricity
and the cause of lightning, and thus to disclose one of the most awful
mysteries of nature.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Pray do tell us something about this electrical kite, papa,” said
Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Not at present, my love; it would divert us too much from the
subjects in which we are engaged: at some future period I shall have
much pleasure in introducing you into these fairy regions of
philosophy.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I just now remember reading in Miss Edgeworth’s Harry and Lucy,” said
Louisa, “something about a kite and Pompey’s pillar.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I am glad that you have reminded me of that story,” replied Mr.
Seymour: “I will relate it to you. Some English sailors laid a wager,
that they would drink a bowl of punch on the summit of Pompey’s
pillar. Now, that pillar is almost a hundred feet high, and it is
quite smooth, so that there was no way of climbing to the top, even
for sailors, who are such experienced climbers: so they flew their
kite exactly over the pillar, and when it came down on the opposite
side, the string lay across the top of the capital. By means of this
string, they pulled a small rope over, and by this a larger one, that
was able to bear the weight of a man; a pulley was then fastened to
the end of the large rope, and drawn close up to the upper edge of the
capital; and then, you perceive, they could easily hoist each other
up. They did more, for they hoisted the English flag on the top, and
then drank the bowl of punch, and won their wager.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“That is a very good story,” said the vicar; “but I cannot help
regretting that so much ingenuity
<span class='pageno' title='243' id='Page_243'></span>and labour should not have had a nobler end to accomplish.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“There is some truth in that observation,” said Mr. Seymour, “and I
will, therefore, relate another story which shall be more congenial to
your heart, and in which the kite will present itself in a more
interesting point of view; for, instead of enabling the sailors to
drink a bowl of punch at an altitude otherwise inaccessible, we shall
find it engaged in rescuing them from the horrors of shipwreck.”<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c017'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c016'>“Pray proceed, papa.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“No, my dear, upon reflection, I think it will be better that we
should postpone the story, until your return to the lodge, when you
shall read it in ‘Harry and Lucy.’ I will also point out to you, in
the same work, an account of a new and useful application of the
messenger, which will prove to you how successfully the faculties of
youth may be increased and improved by those very amusements which are
too generally regarded as idle and unprofitable: I shall at the same
time exhibit one or two experiments in illustration of the nature and
causes of wind.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Shall we not return immediately?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“No, my dear; it would not be in my power to attend you at present;
but join me in the library after dinner; Mr. Twaddleton will now
accompany me to the village, and do you remain and enjoy the amusement
of your kite.”</p>

<p class='c016'>It was not until the evening, that Tom and his sisters requested their
father to fulfil the promises he had made them in the morning.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You told us,” said Louisa, “that you would give us some information
about the wind; the subject has been puzzling me ever since, for I
cannot make out the cause of it.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='244' id='Page_244'></span>“Wind, my love, is nothing more than air in motion; and is produced by
a large volume of it flowing in a current, or stream, from one place,
or region, to another, and with different velocities.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And what can produce these currents?” asked Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“After the explanation of the action of the pump, I do not think that
I shall have much difficulty in making you understand the nature of
the operations by which wind is occasioned. Suppose a partial vacuum
should be formed in any region, would not the neighbouring air
immediately rush in to supply the deficiency and restore the balance?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Undoubtedly; from the pressure of the air behind it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Heat,” continued Mr. Seymour, “will produce a partial vacuum, by
rarefying the air, and thus rendering it lighter; in consequence of
which, it will ascend, and the colder air will rush in to supply its
place.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I do not exactly see why the rarefied air should ascend,” observed
Louisa. “It appears to offer an exception to the general law of
gravity.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Not at all; on the contrary, its ascent is occasioned by the force of
gravity: in the first place, however, to prove the fact that heated
air does actually ascend, we have only to observe the direction of
smoke, as it issues from the chimney; this consists of minute
particles of fuel carried up, by a current of heated air, from the
fire below; and as soon as this current is cooled by mixing with that
of the atmosphere, the minute particles of coal fall, and produce the
small black flakes which render the air, and every thing in contact
with it, so dirty in a populous city.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“But I want to know, papa, what it is which causes the hot air to
ascend?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The greater weight of the cold air above it, which
<span class='pageno' title='245' id='Page_245'></span>gets, as it were, beneath the lighter air, and obliges it to rise; just in
the same way as a piece of cork, at the bottom of an empty vessel, is
made to rise to the surface of the water which may be poured into it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Now I understand it; pray, therefore, proceed with your account of
the wind. You have just said that heat rarefies the air, and causes it
to ascend.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And thus produces a current of air, or a <i>wind</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Is heat, then, the cause of wind, papa?” asked Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is one great cause; but there are, probably, several others; I
will, however, exemplify this subject by an experiment.”</p>

<p class='c016'>So saying, Mr. Seymour produced a water-plate, a large dish, and a jug
filled with cold water. The bell was rung, and the servant entered
with a tea-kettle of boiling water.</p>

<p class='c016'>The large dish was then filled with the cold, and the water-plate with
the boiling fluid.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Let this large dish represent the ocean,” said Mr. Seymour, “and this
water-plate, which I will now place in its centre, an island in that
ocean; for the land, from receiving the rays of the sun, will be more
heated than the water, and will consequently rarefy the air above
it.--Now, Tom, light me the wax taper.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I have done so.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Then now blow it out.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I cannot imagine what you are about, papa;--‘Light the candle, and
then blow it out!’--but it still smokes, shall I put the extinguisher
over it?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“By no means; give it to me, and observe what will happen when I carry
it round the edge of the dish.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The smoke goes to the centre,” exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Showing, thereby, the existence of a current towards the water-plate,
or island; in consequence of
<span class='pageno' title='246' id='Page_246'></span>the air above it having been heated, and therefore rarefied. This explains
in a very satisfactory manner, a fact which may be constantly observed
in our own climate, viz. a gentle breeze blowing from the sea to the
land in the heat of the day. Upon the same principle it is, that most
of the winds in different parts of the globe may be readily accounted
for.”<a href='#note42'>(42)</a></p>

<p class='c016'>“I suppose,” said Tom, “that the air must rush with great velocity, in
order to produce wind.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“A very general error prevails upon this subject,” replied his father;
“the rate of motion has been greatly exaggerated. In a brisk gale,
even, the wind does not travel with such velocity, but that it may be
easily traced by the eye; and the sailor is able to watch its progress
by the ripple which it produces on the sea.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Has, then, the rate of its motion ever been estimated?” asked Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“When its velocity is about two miles per hour, it is only just
perceptible. In a high wind, the air travels thirty or forty miles in
the same period. In a storm, its rate has been computed as being from
sixty to eighty miles. It has also been ascertained, by experiment,
that the air, as it rushes from a pair of blacksmith’s bellows, has
not a velocity above that of five and forty miles in the hour.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“At what rate should you think the air travelled this morning, when we
flew our kite?” enquired Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I should think at about five miles an hour, for it was a pleasant but
gentle breeze.”</p>

<p class='c030'><span class='pageno' title='247' id='Page_247'></span><i>A short discourse.--The Shuttlecock.--The solution of two
problems connected with its flight.--The Windmill.--The
Smoke-jack.--A toy constructed on the same principle.--The Bow
and Arrow.--Archery.--The arrival of Isabella Villers.</i></p>

<p class='c024'>Mr. Twaddleton, on his arrival at the lodge, on the following morning,
was informed that Miss Villers was expected at Overton in the evening.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Your account of that young lady,” observed the vicar, “has greatly
prepossessed me in her favour; I only hope that she is not too
<i>blue</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I care not how blue the stockings of a lady may be,” said Mr.
Seymour, “‘provided her petticoats be long enough to hide them;’ and
from my knowledge of Miss Villers, I can assure you, exalted as are
her
<span class='pageno' title='248' id='Page_248'></span>attainments, they are so veiled by feminine delicacy and reserve, that
they may insidiously win, but will never extort our homage.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Ay, ay,” exclaimed the vicar; “I perfectly agree with you in your
idea of feminine perfection--short tongues and long petticoats, Mr.
Seymour.--But where are my little playmates?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I left Tom and Fanny on the terrace, a short time since,” replied Mr.
Seymour, “very busily engaged in the game of shuttlecock and
battledoor.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The shuttlecock is an ancient sport,” observed Mr. Twaddleton. “It is
represented in a manuscript as far back as the fourteenth century: and
it became a fashionable game amongst grown persons in the reign of
James the First.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is a very healthy pastime,” said Mr. Seymour, “and, in my opinion,
is admirably calculated for females; for, it expands the chest, while
it creates a graceful pliancy of the limbs.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I entirely agree with you; it is the only game with which I am
acquainted, in which muscular exercise is gained without compromising
gracefulness. But see, here come the two young rogues.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Papa,” exclaimed Tom, “I have been considering whether there is any
philosophy in the game of shuttlecock.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“There are two circumstances connected with its flight,” replied his
father, “which certainly will admit of explanation upon scientific
principles; and I should much like to hear whether you can apply them
for that purpose. The first is its spinning motion in the air; the
second, the regularity with which its base of cork always presents
itself to the battledoor; so that, after you have struck it, it turns
round, and arrives at your sister’s battledoor in a position to be
again struck by her, and sent back to you.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I perfectly understand what you mean; but I
<span class='pageno' title='249' id='Page_249'></span>really am not able to explain the motions to which you allude,” said
Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The revolution of the shuttlecock, about its axis, entirely depends
upon the impulse of the wind on the oblique surfaces of its feathers;
so that it is often necessary to trim the feathers of a new
shuttlecock, before it will spin.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I understand you, papa; the force of the wind, by striking the
oblique feathers, is resolved into a perpendicular and parallel force,
as you explained to us, when we considered the action of the wind upon
the kite.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Exactly; every oblique direction of a motion is the diagonal of a
parallelogram, whose perpendicular and parallel directions are the two
sides. Having settled this point, let us consider the second; viz. how
it happens that the cork of the shuttlecock always presents itself to
the battledoor.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I should think,” said Tom, “that the cork points to the battledoor
for the same reason that the weathercock always points to the wind.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Admirably illustrated!” exclaimed his father; “the cork will always
go foremost; because the air must exert a greater force over the
lighter feathers, and therefore retard their progress. While we are
upon this subject, I will introduce to your notice some contrivances
which are indebted to this same principle for their operation. In the
first place, there is the arrow; can you tell me, Louisa, the use of
the feathers which are placed round its extremity?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“To make its head proceed foremost in the air, by rendering its other
end lighter, and therefore more sensible to the resistance of the
air,” replied Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Very well answered; that is, unquestionably, one of the objects of
the wings of an arrow; but there is also another, that of <i>rifling</i>
it, or steadying its
<span class='pageno' title='250' id='Page_250'></span>progressive motion, by causing it to revolve around its axis. If you will look at
this arrow, you will perceive that the feathers are placed nearly, but
not quite, in planes passing through it; if the feathers were exactly
in this plane, the air could not strike against their surfaces when
the arrow is in motion: but, since they are not perfectly straight,
but always a little aslant, the air necessarily strikes them, as the
arrow moves forward; by which force the feathers are turned round, and
with them the arrow or reed; so that a motion is generated about its
axis; and its velocity will increase with the obliquity of the
feathers. You will therefore observe that, in order to enable the
feathers to offer a necessary resistance to the air, they must possess
a certain degree of stiffness or inflexibility. It was on this account
that Roger Ascham,<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c017'><sup>[46]</sup></a> and other skilful artists in the days of
archery, preferred the feathers of a goose of two or three years old,
especially such as drop of themselves, for pluming the arrow; and the
importance, as well as the theory of this choice, is confirmed by a
curious observation of Gervase Markham,<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c017'><sup>[47]</sup></a> who says that ‘the peacock
feather was sometimes used at the short butt; yet, seldom or ever,
<i>did it keep the shaft either right or level</i>!’”<a href='#note43'>(43)</a></p>

<p class='c016'>“That is intelligible enough,” said Tom, “the feather of the peacock
must have been so flexible as to have yielded to the slightest breath
of air; and now, as we are upon the subject of the arrow, do explain
to us the action of the bow.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I shall readily comply with your request, before we part; but I am
desirous, at present, of following up the subject before us, and of
taking into consideration some other instruments which owe their
motions to the action of the air upon oblique surfaces.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='251' id='Page_251'></span>“Suppose,” said the vicar, “you explain to them the action of the wind
upon the sails of the mill.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I should like to hear something about the windmill,” observed Tom;
“and, perhaps, Mr. Twaddleton can tell us who invented the machine.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The invention is not of very remote date,” replied the vicar.
“According to some authors, windmills were first used in France in the
sixth century; while others maintain that they were brought to Europe
in the time of the crusades, and that they had long been employed in
the East, where the scarcity of water precluded the application of
that powerful agent to machinery.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I had intended,” said Mr. Seymour, “to have entered very fully upon
the subject of the windmill; for, although it is a very common
machine, its construction is much more ingenious than is generally
imagined; it must also be allowed to have a degree of perfection, to
which few of the popular engines have yet arrived: but to do ample
justice to my subject, I should require several models which are not
yet in readiness; besides, Tom’s holidays have nearly passed away; I
must therefore postpone the examination of the mill to some future
opportunity, and content myself, at present, with an explanation of
its sails.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And let me tell you,” observed the vicar, “that if you succeed in
this one object, you will accomplish a task which has occupied years
of mechanical research. The angle which the surface of the sails ought
to make with their axis, in order that the wind may have the greatest
effect, or the degree of <i>weathering</i>, as the millwrights call it, is
a matter of nice enquiry, and has much engaged the thoughts of the
mathematicians.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“My remarks upon that subject will be very general,” said Mr. Seymour;
“I shall explain the principle, without entering into the minutiæ of
its applications.
<span class='pageno' title='252' id='Page_252'></span>The vertical windmill, which is the kind in most common use, consists, as
you well know, of an axis, or shaft, placed in the direction of the
wind, and usually inclining a little upwards from the horizontal line.
At one end of this, four long arms, or yards, are fixed perpendicular
to the axis, and across each other at right angles; these afford a
surface, on which a cloth can be spread to receive the action of the
wind. To conceive why these sails should revolve by the force of the
wind, we must have recourse to the theory of compound motion. It is
very evident that, if a mill exposed directly to the wind should have
its four sails perpendicular to the common axis in which they are
fitted, they would receive the wind perpendicularly, an impulse which
could only tend to overturn them; there is a necessity, therefore, to
have them oblique to the common axis, that they may receive the wind
obliquely, when their effort to recede from it causes them to tarn
round with the axis; and the four sails being all made oblique in the
same direction, thus unite their efforts for the common object.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You have not yet told us what degree of obliquity the sail ought to
make with the wind,” said the vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The same as the kite ought to make, <i>fifty-four</i> degrees and
<i>forty-four</i> minutes,” replied Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Do you not remember, papa, when we were last in London, you pointed
out to us a curious mill on the banks of the river, which went without
any sails?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You allude to the horizontal mill at Battersea.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I remember it was at Battersea,” observed Louisa; “and I dare say,
papa, that you recollect the strange story which the waterman, who
rowed us down the river, told Tom and myself. He said
<span class='pageno' title='253' id='Page_253'></span>‘that, when the Emperor of Russia was in London, he took a fancy to the neat
little church at Battersea, and determined to carry it off to Russia;
and that for this purpose he had sent a large packing-case; but, as
the inhabitants refused to let the church be carried away, the case
remained on the spot where it was deposited.’”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is not a bad story,” said her father; “for the mill certainly,
both in size and figure, may be imagined to resemble a gigantic
packing-case. The mill, of which you are speaking, has been taken
down, in consequence of its use having been superseded by the
introduction of steam. It was erected by Captain Hooper, who also
built a similar one at Margate. It consisted of a circular wheel,
having large boards or vanes fixed parallel to its axis, and arranged
at equal distances from each other. Upon these vanes the wind could
act, so as to blow the wheel round; but had it acted upon the vane at
both sides of the wheel, at once, it is evident that it could not have
had any tendency to turn it round; hence, one side of the wheel was
sheltered, while the other was submitted to the full action of the
wind. For this purpose it was enclosed within a large cylindrical
framework, furnished with doors or shutters, on all sides, to open at
pleasure and admit the wind, or to shut and stop it. If all the
shutters on one side were open, whilst all those on the opposite side
were closed, the wind, acting with undiminished force on the vanes at
one side, whilst the opposite vanes were under shelter, turned the
mill round; but whenever the wind changed, the disposition of the
blinds was altered, to admit the wind to strike upon the vanes of the
wheel in the direction of a tangent to the circle in which they
moved.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well; have you any other machine to explain to your scholars?” asked
the vicar; “for,” continued
<span class='pageno' title='254' id='Page_254'></span>he, “I am anxious to present them with a bow and arrow which I have
provided for their amusement.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I will, if you please, first describe to them the mechanism of the
smoke-jack; and I am desirous of doing so, as I have a very pleasing
experiment to exhibit, which is founded upon the same principle.”</p>
<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/figp271a.png' alt='Smoke-jack.' class='c052' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour then described the more common form of this machine. It
consisted, he said, of a number of vanes, of thin sheet-iron, arranged
in a circle, as here represented, but all set obliquely at a proper
angle of inclination. Its action was explained in the following
manner:--When a fire is kindled in the chimney, the air which, by its
rarefaction, immediately tends to ascend, strikes on the surfaces of
the inclined vanes, and by a resolution of forces, similar to that
already explained, causes the spindle, to which they are affixed, to
turn round, and consequently communicates the same motion to the spit.
The brisker the fire becomes, the quicker will the machine move,
because in that case, the air ascends with greater rapidity.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I will now exhibit to you a mechanical amusement which is founded on
the same principle,” said Mr. Seymour. “Fetch me the piece of
pasteboard which lies on the library table.”</p>

<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/figp271b.png' alt='Simple spiral shape.' class='c039' />
</div>

<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/figp272.png' alt='“Mechanical amusement” as described' class='c036' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>The pasteboard was produced, and Mr. Seymour described upon it a
spiral, similar to that which is represented in the annexed figure.
The spiral was cut out, and extended, by raising the centre above the
first revolution. It was then suspended upon a small spit of iron,
which had been previously prepared; by applying the centre or summit
of its spiral to its point. The whole was now
<span class='pageno' title='255' id='Page_255'></span>placed on the top of a warm stove, (the application of a lamp would have
answered the same purpose,) and the machine, to the great delight and
astonishment of the children, soon put itself in motion, and turned
without the assistance of any apparent agent. The agent, however, in
this case, was the air, which being rarefied by the contact of a warm
body, ascended, and thus produced a current. The accompanying sketch
may render this experiment more intelligible to the reader.</p>

<p class='c016'>The vicar observed that, to him, the experiment was perfectly novel;
although he remembered having seen what he now supposed must have been
a similar contrivance, but which, until that moment, he had always
considered as the effect of clockwork.</p>

<p class='c016'>“And what might that have been?” asked Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The revolution of a serpent, which I noticed in several windows in
London, during a late illumination.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Undoubtedly; it was nothing more than a spiral, so painted as to
resemble that reptile, and which owed its motion to the action of air
heated by a lamp placed beneath it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Now, then,” exclaimed the vicar, “let us direct our attention to the
bow and arrow; see the present I have provided for you, Tom!”</p>

<p class='c016'>So saying, the worthy clergyman produced a bow and a number of arrows,
together with a target; which, at his desire, had been sent from
London.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I think,” observed Mr. Seymour, “that you should accompany your gift
with some account of archery, or the art and exercise of shooting with
the bow and arrow.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“That will I readily do,” replied Mr. Twaddleton; who accordingly
proceeded as follows:--</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='256' id='Page_256'></span>“The bow is the most ancient and universal of all weapons, and has
been found to obtain amongst the most barbarous and remote nations. In
the days of David the practice of the bow would appear to have been so
general, that it was not unfrequently made use of as a figure of
speech. Israel, when blessing his sons, says of Joseph, ‘the <i>archers</i>
have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him; but his <i>bow</i>
abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong, by the
hands of the mighty God of Jacob.’”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Its earliest application was probably for the purpose of obtaining
food,” observed Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Your conjecture has the weight of testimony,” replied the vicar;
“when Isaac sent Esau to the forest, he said, ‘Take, I pray thee, thy
weapons, thy quiver, and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me
some venison:’<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c017'><sup>[48]</sup></a> and it is even a question, whether the <i>Saxon</i> bow
was ever used by the Anglo-Saxons and Danes for any other purpose than
that of procuring food, or pastime; for the representation of this
bow, in an ancient manuscript<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c017'><sup>[49]</sup></a> of the tenth century, shows it to
have been very differently constructed from what one might expect in a
military weapon; in size, too, it was a mere toy, compared with the
bow of succeeding ages.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“There can be no doubt that the bow and arrow were employed for the
purpose of killing animals for food from the earliest times; but its
principal interest is derived from its military applications; will
you, therefore, give us a sketch of its history, and confine yourself
to its practice as a warlike instrument in England?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And may I also beg of you, my dear sir,” added Mrs. Seymour, “to
explain the different terms which are employed to denote its parts and
applications; such information will be, just now, highly acceptable
<span class='pageno' title='257' id='Page_257'></span>to me, as I am reading some romances, in which those terms are constantly
occurring.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You shall be obeyed, madam,” replied the vicar, with a courteous
smile.</p>

<p class='c016'>“We are, probably, indebted to the Norman conquest for the
introduction of the bow and arrow as a hostile weapon; but, before I
enter upon that subject, it is necessary to state, that the bows in
use in England, have been of two kinds, the common or <i>long</i> bow, and
the <i>cross</i> bow. The former does not require any description from me,
the latter, or <i>Arbalet</i>, as it was called, (from <i>Arbalesta</i>, i. e.
<i>arcu-balista</i>, a bow with a sling,) consists of a steel bow, fastened
upon a stock, and is discharged by means of a catch, or <i>trigger</i>,
which probably gave rise to the lock upon the modern musket.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Excuse the interruption,” said Mrs. Seymour, “but do allow me to ask
whether <i>Arquebusade</i> does not derive its name from its having been
formerly applied to wounds inflicted by the cross-bow or <i>Arbalet</i>?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I thank you, madam; that etymology is entirely new to me, and will
explain the medical name, <i>Aqua vulneraria</i>, which has been applied to
that spirit.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The vicar now proceeded without further interruption.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The invention of cross-bows is said by ancient writers to have come
from the Sicilians. They were first used in England by the Normans at
the battle of Hastings; and a <i>quarrel</i> or <i>bar-bolt</i> (which is
synonymous with the arrow of the long-bow) was the immediate cause of
Harold’s death. In the reign of Stephen, in 1139, the second council
of Lateran prohibited their use; and some historians assert, that they
were not again used in this country till the reign of Richard I.,
whose death, occasioned by one at Chaluz, was considered as a judgment
on his impiety.
<span class='pageno' title='258' id='Page_258'></span>From the death of Richard till the splendid victories of Edward III.,
we hear little of the cross-bow as a military weapon. Its use appears
to have been principally confined to the sieges of fortified places,
and to sea-fights. In 1346, at the battle of Cressy, a large body of
Genoese soldiers, who were particularly expert in its management, were
in the service of the French; but at the commencement of the action, a
sudden shower wetted the strings, and prevented the archers from doing
their usual execution, while the English were still capable of
annoying their enemies by the long-bow with complete success: both
this victory and that of Poictiers, ten years afterwards, were chiefly
ascribed by the English to their archers. In 1403, at the battle of
Shrewsbury, where Hotspur was slain, the archers on both sides did
terrible execution; and the victory of Agincourt, in 1417, was
entirely owing to their skill. Under Edward IV. an ordinance was made,
that every Englishman and Irishman, dwelling in England, should have a
bow of his own height, to be made of yew, wych, hazel, ash, or any
other seasonable tree, according to their power. By Henry VII. and his
son Henry VIII. the use of the cross-bow was entirely forbidden; and a
penalty of ten pounds was to be inflicted on every man in whose house
one might be found. From this time they seem to have been chiefly used
for killing deer.<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c017'><sup>[50]</sup></a> Henry VIII. compelled every father to provide a
long-bow and two arrows for his son at seven years old. Edward VI.,
Elizabeth, and James, all encouraged archery: John Lyon, who founded
Harrow school in 1590, two years before his death, drew up rules for
its direction, whereby the amusements of the scholars were confined to
‘driving a top, tossing a hand-ball, running, and shooting.’ The last
mentioned diversion is in a manner insisted on by the
<span class='pageno' title='259' id='Page_259'></span>founder, who requires all parents to furnish their children with
bow-strings, shafts, and tresters, to exercise shooting. A silver
arrow used some years ago to be shot for by the young gentlemen of
that school.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The vicar concluded, and received the thanks of the party for the
interesting information he had afforded them.</p>

<p class='c016'>“There is one circumstance connected with the military history of the
long-bow,” said Mrs. Seymour, “which has somewhat surprised me; and
that is, why it should so long have continued in estimation after the
use of gunpowder.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“That circumstance,” replied her husband, “will cease to astonish you,
when you remember that, until the last century, muskets were very
unwieldy instruments; they were never used without a rest; had no
bayonets, and could not be so frequently discharged as they are at
present.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Come,” said the vicar, “I perceive that the children are impatient to
try their skill with their new instrument; let us walk out, and I will
play the Scythian<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c017'><sup>[51]</sup></a> upon this occasion.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Now, Tom,” cried Mr. Twaddleton; “we must have an object. Let me see.
Shall it be the ‘<i>but</i>,’ ‘<i>pricke</i>,’ or ‘<i>roaver</i>?’<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c017'><sup>[52]</sup></a> Come, try
whether you can hit yonder gate-post. Take your bow, and here is an
arrow.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Tom took the bow, and placing the arrow on the string, was about to
draw the latter, when the vicar exclaimed, “Stop--stop--you must pull
back your hand to your right ear, in order to shoot the arrow; whereas
you have placed the bow directly before
<span class='pageno' title='260' id='Page_260'></span>you, and are about to return your hand to the right breast.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I thought,” said Tom, “that was the proper position; for I remember
reading of the Amazonian women, who are said to have parted with their
right breasts, lest they should prove an impediment to their using the
bow.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I do not mean to assert,” replied the vicar, “that there is not ample
classical authority for your proceeding. The Amazons undoubtedly shot
their arrows in such a position; and so, in truth, did the primitive
Grecians; although the ancient Persians drew the arrow to the ear,
according to the fashion of later ages, and which I greatly prefer for
its superior convenience. You may also recollect, as you have been
lately reading ‘The Tales of a Grandfather,’ that the superiority of
the English archers was ascribed to this mode of using their bows; the
words of Sir W. Scott, if I rightly recollect, are these, ‘The archers
of England were taught to draw the bow-string to their right ear,
while other European nations only drew it to the breast.’ Now,”
continued the vicar, “if you try the difference of these postures, you
will find that a much longer arrow can be drawn to the ear than to the
breast, because the right arm has more room.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The party now amused themselves for some time; each shooting in his
turn at the mark which was chosen for the trial; and with a success
which, considering it was their first attempt, the vicar declared to
be “quite marvellous.”</p>

<p class='c016'>At the conclusion of the sport, Mr. Twaddleton informed his friends,
that parochial duties required his attendance at the vestry, but Mr.
Seymour told him that he should expect his company in the evening.</p>

<p class='c016'>It was just six o’clock, when the sound of the porter’s bell, and the
rolling of carriage-wheels, announced
<span class='pageno' title='261' id='Page_261'></span>the approach of some important stranger to the lodge. It was Miss
Villers. Were this a romance rather than an instructive history, we
should, at once, charge our pencil with the glowing hues of the
rainbow, and proceed to colour the outline which the imagination of
the reader must have already sketched: but the character of the
present composition fortunately renders such a task unnecessary; we
say “fortunately,” for the magazines of romance have actually become
insolvent from the numerous and heavy drafts of the novel-writer; the
regions of fancy have been so despoiled of their blossoms, that
scarcely a flower can be culled by him who would entwine a garland for
the brow of his heroine; and such even as may have escaped the grasp
of this voracious horde, will be found to have faded under the
withering influence of those insects of literature, which, fluttering
or creeping about their petals, have rendered their fragrance
pestilential, and turned their honey into bitterness. Where can be
found the emblem of that damask lip which, arched like the bow of
Cupid, shot an unerring dart, whenever a smile relaxed its tension? We
might describe the perfect symmetry of her form, but what language
could convey to the mind’s eye the witcheries with which the graces
had surrounded it? We might depict the features of her countenance,
but how could we catch and fix the varying expressions which lighted
it up with the magic glow of intelligence? We must, therefore,
exercise the judgment of Timanthes, and leave the reader to the sway
of his own imagination.</p>

<p class='c024'>On the following morning, Miss Villers, accompanied by her friends,
proceeded to Osterley Park, to pay her compliments to Major Snapwell,
and to add her entreaties to those of Mr. and Mrs. Seymour to induce
the venerable Major to spend a few days at Overton Lodge. The
children, of course, had a holiday; but was it a holiday? Tom and his
sister have been frequently heard to declare that they never passed a
more dull and listless day; and on resuming their scientific sports,
their manner sufficiently testified that increased pleasure which
always accompanies our return to an agreeable occupation.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Mr. Twaddleton,” said Miss Villers, addressing the worthy vicar as he
entered the library at Overton, “I am happy to say that Major Snapwell
has consented to pass a few days with us, and I learn from him that
you have been most delightfully engaged in promoting a new scheme of
scientific instruction; it is a subject which greatly interests me,
and I shall be most happy in being allowed to become one of your
party. To the merits of this system I am no stranger,” continued the
lady, “nor am I unacquainted, sir, with the advantages which your
antiquarian knowledge has conferred; you have garnished the
intellectual banquet with some of the choicest flowers of
literature.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='263' id='Page_263'></span>“You do me far too much honour, madam,” said the vicar, as a gracious
smile flitted over his countenance; “but I rejoice to find that you
attach a becoming importance to the researches of the antiquary. May I
be allowed to hope that you will favour me with a visit at the
vicarage, and inspect my poor collection of antiques?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I anticipate a great treat, I do assure you,” said Miss Villers; “but
you speak too humbly of a collection which the major informs me
contains some of the rarest relics of ancient days.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The major, madam, is no doubt a judge, an excellent judge, although
he is occasionally----but no matter--no matter. I certainly, as he
justly says, do possess some few remarkable specimens. I have, for
instance, an undoubted specimen of the leathern money coined by John
of France; some very tolerable samples of tapestry of the ‘high and
low warp;’ a series of sigilla or seals; as well as an interesting
collection of impressions in wax, taken from grants of William the
Conqueror, and what is curious, the colour of these waxen impressions
is, without any exception, green, with a view, as it has been said, to
signify that the acts should for ever continue fresh and in force. Let
me consider,” continued the vicar, “what other curiosities can I
display for your delight and approbation? Rock-basins; yes, the
rock-basins from Carn-breh. Ay, madam, you will be quite astonished at
a specimen which--” At this instant, Mr. and Mrs. Seymour, followed by
the children, entered the apartment, and abruptly cut the thread of
the vicar’s harangue.</p>

<p class='c016'>“What do I hear?” exclaimed Mr. Seymour. “Rock-basins! for mercy’s
sake, my dear vicar, let us not again dive into those horrid basins of
Druidism; do but consider the martyrdom I have suffered on account of
those pools of lustration.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well, well,” replied the vicar pettishly, “I will
<span class='pageno' title='264' id='Page_264'></span>consent to reserve the question for Miss Villers’s opinion, who, I
have no doubt, will readily assent to their authenticity. But I have
another treasure lately obtained from Cornwall, which you have not yet
seen--a Sepulchral stone!--‘<i>In vestibulo astat</i>,’ as the poet has
it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Why I never observed it as I passed through the entrance,” said Mr.
Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Excuse me,” observed the vicar, “the <i>Vestibule</i>, if you please. You
doubtless know it was a custom amongst the Romans to have an altar
sacred to Vesta in the entrance of their houses, and hence the
term;--but I beg a thousand pardons--‘<i>venia sit dicto</i>’--I am perhaps
too critical.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Not only pardon, but thanks, my dear sir, for the information you
have afforded us,” said Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>Miss Villers was now invited to be present at one of the scientific
conversations.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I shall be grateful to you for so pleasing a privilege,” observed the
young lady; “and,” continued she, “may I be allowed to ask whether you
have not been lately teaching my young friends the operation of those
various toys, which act by the force of the air; the object I have in
view in asking this question you shall presently hear.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Papa has lately taught us the reason of the kite’s ascent, and the
action of the squirt, sucker, and pump,” said Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“So I understood; and before you proceed with your sportive
philosophy, I hope your papa will allow you to try whether you can
solve an enigma I have composed for you.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“A riddle!” exclaimed Louisa; “how delightful! Pray read it, papa, and
let us try to discover its meaning.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Her father then opened the paper with which Miss Villers had presented
him, and read as follows:--</p>

</div>

<p class='c016'>“It is extremely pretty,” exclaimed Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is beautiful,” said Tom; “but I should like to find out the riddle
it contains. What can that be which grinds our corn, and carries our
ships across the sea? Canvass? Yes; canvass clothes the sails of the
windmill and forms those of the ship.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And therefore visits every clime; while, as long as the sails remain
fixed, they are quite tractable and steady,” added Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“It will not do, Louisa; it cannot be canvass: for the sail is never
boisterous when it is controlled; but when let loose, it shivers in
the wind and is very unruly; whereas it is said in the riddle, ‘When
uncontroll’d my nature’s mild,’ which is quite the reverse. Let me
see. Can it be string? My top could not hum without string.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“How can string prevent the modest maid from fading like a flower?
What says the vicar?” asked Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“<i>Davus sum, non Œdipus</i>,” exclaimed Mr. Twaddleton.</p>

<p class='c016'>At this moment Miss Villers whispered in the ear of her little
favourite, who shortly afterwards exclaimed, “I have it, Tom,--it is
<b><span class='fss'>AIR</span></b>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The juvenile group now attentively perused the enigma, in order to
discover whether its different parts would admit of such an
interpretation. As soon as they arrived at the passage in which was
<span class='pageno' title='267' id='Page_267'></span>described the waving of the banners over the bier of Nelson, Tom declared that
his sister must be wrong; and was proceeding to offer his reasons,
when Mr. Seymour interrupted him, by observing, it was that passage
which first suggested to his mind the solution of the enigma; and
satisfied him that Louisa was perfectly right.</p>

<p class='c016'>“It so happened,” continued he, “that I was present during the awful
ceremony of Nelson’s interment in St. Paul’s; and never shall I forget
the thrilling effect which was produced on the assembled multitude, by
the solemn movement of the banners in the dome, as the bier slowly
advanced along the aisle of the cathedral; and which was accidentally
occasioned by a current of air from the western entrance, although, to
the eye of fancy, it seemed as if some attendant spirit had directed
the colours, under which the hero had bled and conquered, to offer
this supernatural testimony of respect and sorrow.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Miss Villers observed, that Louisa had unquestionably solved the
riddle.</p>

<p class='c016'>“And pray, my dear Mr. Twaddleton,” said Mrs. Seymour, “what say you
to these puzzles and rhyming conundrums? Do you hold them in as much
horror as you would so many puns?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“By no means, my good madam. An enigma is a perfectly orthodox species
of composition; and is, indeed, sanctioned by the highest authorities
of antiquity.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I believe,” observed Mr. Seymour, “that the pastime of riddle-making
was extremely popular amongst the Grecians. Plutarch, if I remember
correctly, has told us that the girls of his time worked at netting or
sewing, and that the most ingenious amongst them ‘made riddles.’”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The most ancient riddle on record,” replied the vicar, “is to be
found in the fourteenth chapter of the book of Judges.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='268' id='Page_268'></span>“<i>And Samson said unto them, ‘I will now put forth a riddle unto you;
if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast,
and find it out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty changes
of garments.’ And they said unto him, ‘Put forth thy riddle that we
may hear it.’ And he said unto them, ‘Out of the eater came forth
meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness.</i>’”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And did they find it out?” asked Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“My dear boy,” replied the vicar, “you must read the chapter to which
I have alluded, and you will thence learn all about this enigma.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“We have also numerous riddles in prophane writers of ancient date,”
observed Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Did you ever read of that invented by Cleobulus, one of the seven
wise men of Greece, who lived 570 years before Christ?” enquired the
vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Pray be so kind as to relate it,” said Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Twaddleton, in compliance with this request, proceeded as
follows:--</p>

<p class='c016'>“There is a father with twice six sons; these sons have each thirty
daughters, who are parti-coloured, having one cheek white, the other
black. They never see each other’s faces, nor live above twenty-four
hours.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“A very strange and unsociable family!” observed Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I should never guess it,” said Tom, “if I were to dedicate a year to
it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You have, nevertheless, my boy, just pronounced the name of the said
father, and that, too, after a single moment’s consideration,” replied
the vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The name of the father!--how?--where?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is a <b><span class='fss'>YEAR</span></b>!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“A year!” exclaimed the astonished boy.</p>

<p class='c016'>“A year!” echoed Louisa; “to be sure it is; I now see it all clearly.
His ‘twice six sons’ are the twelve months; the ‘thirty daughters’ the
days of
<span class='pageno' title='269' id='Page_269'></span>each month; and, since one day must necessarily pass away before the next
can arrive, they may be truly said never to see each other’s faces.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Admirably expounded!” cried the vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>“And each day,” added Tom, “is certainly ‘parti-coloured,’ as it is
made up of light and darkness.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Good, again! The quick apprehension of these my little playmates,”
said Mr. Twaddleton, as he turned towards Miss Villers, “is highly
interesting; their minds, from well-regulated discipline, have
acquired the faculty, if I may be allowed the use of the metaphor, of
<i>winnowing</i> a subject, so as completely to separate the grain from the
chaff.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is my intention to proceed this morning with the consideration of
those toys which have the property of producing sound,” said Mr.
Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I suppose you mean the whistle, whiz-gig, and humming-top,” observed
Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Your papa, no doubt, alludes to those instruments,” said the vicar,
“and I greatly approve of the arrangement; since our last lecture
embraced the operations of the atmosphere, a subject with which the
nature of sound is certainly intimately connected.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“We have lately considered the phenomenon of wind, as produced by the
motions of the atmosphere, and I now propose to investigate another
species of agitation of which the air is susceptible, a kind of
vibratory or tremulous motion, which, striking on the drum of the ear,
produces <b><span class='fss'>SOUND</span></b>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Is it the air which produces sound!” said Louisa, with much surprise;
“I thought it was always occasioned by the vibrations of solid bodies.
Well do I remember, when Tom struck the finger-glass, that you
immediately silenced the sound by placing your hand upon it, and which
you told us stopped the vibration of the glass, and so destroyed the
sound.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You speak the truth, but not the whole truth,”
<span class='pageno' title='270' id='Page_270'></span>replied her father. “Sound is undoubtedly the result of certain motions, or
vibrations, produced in sonorous bodies, but these vibrations are
communicated to the air, and from thence to the ear, in a manner which
I shall presently explain.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Do you mean to say, papa, that, if air were entirely excluded, bodies
would be incapable of producing sound when struck?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Not exactly. Air is the usual conductor of sound, and unless some
other medium be substituted, the removal of it would prevent a
sonorous body from communicating any sensation to the ear. Liquids,
however, are capable of conveying the vibratory motion to the organ of
hearing; for sound can be heard under water. Solid bodies will also
convey it, and in a much more perfect and rapid manner<a href='#note44'>(44)</a>; thus the
slightest scratch with a pin, upon one end of a long piece of timber,
will be distinctly heard on applying the ear to its opposite
extremity. The tramping of a horse is to be perceived at a greater
distance by listening with the ear in contact with the ground, than by
attending to the sound conveyed through the air; and hence, amongst
many eastern tribes, it is a common practice to ascertain the approach
of an enemy, by applying the ear to the ground. Upon the same
principle, if we place our ear against a long brick wall, and desire a
person at a considerable distance to strike it <i>once</i> with a hammer,
it will be heard <i>twice</i>, the first sound travelling along the wall,
the second through the air.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I thank you for that hint,” said the vicar. “I now understand the
principle of a new instrument which Dr. Doseall employs for examining
the pulsations of the heart. He places the end of a wooden rod upon
the breast, and applying the other extremity to his ear, declares that
the sounds, thus conveyed to it, enable him to form the most accurate
opinion in cases of diseased chest.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='271' id='Page_271'></span>“In the same manner,” observed Mrs. Seymour, “that you may hear the
boiling of the tea-kettle, by placing the end of the poker on the
vessel, and applying your ear to the handle.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I do not exactly understand what you mean by a <i>sonorous</i> body. Will
not every body produce a sound when struck?” asked Fanny.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Those bodies are called <i>sonorous</i>, which produce clear, distinct,
regular, and durable sounds, such as a bell, a drum, musical strings,
wind instruments, and so on.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And upon what does this peculiar property depend?” enquired Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Before I answer that question, I must explain the supposed nature of
those vibrations of the air, upon which sound depends; you will then
readily perceive why one species of matter should be better calculated
than another for exciting them. It is generally believed that sound is
conveyed through air by a succession of pulsations similar to those
which are occasioned on the surface of smooth water by throwing a
pebble into it. This at first produces a small circular wave round the
spot in which the stone falls; the wave spreads, and gradually
communicates its motion to the adjacent waters, producing similar
waves to a considerable extent. The same kind of waves are produced in
the air by the motion of a sonorous body, which will of course be in
the centre, and the waves or pulsations will diminish in strength as
they recede from that centre, until at last they become too weak to
produce any effect on the ear.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“When I strike a bell, then do I produce exactly the same motion in
the air, that I do in the water by throwing a stone into it?” asked
Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“With this difference,” replied her father, “that as air is an elastic
fluid, the motion does not consist of regularly extending waves, but
of vibrations, which
<span class='pageno' title='272' id='Page_272'></span>are composed of a motion forwards and backwards; the undulations of the
air differ also from those of the water, in not being confined to a
plane, but in diverging in all directions from the centre; or, in
other words, the aërial undulations are spherical.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is a very puzzling subject,” cried Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I cannot understand,” said Louisa, “how the motion of the air can
extend so as to convey sound to a distance, if, as papa says, the air
moves backwards as well as forwards.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I see your difficulty, and will endeavour to remove it; attend to me.
The first set of undulations which are produced immediately around the
sonorous body, by pressing against the contiguous air, condense it.
The condensed air, though impelled forward by the pressure, re-acts on
the first set of undulations, driving them back again. The second set
which have been put in action, in their turn, communicate their
motion, and are themselves driven back by reaction. Thus there is a
succession of waves in the air, corresponding with the succession of
waves in the water.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Now I understand why sound requires some time to travel from a
distant object to the ear, as you explained to us upon a former
occasion,”<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c017'><sup>[53]</sup></a> said Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“But you have not yet told us what renders a body sonorous,” observed
Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Its elasticity: a ball of damp clay, which does not possess this
property, will produce no other sound, when struck, but that which
arises from the condensation of the small portion of air between the
clay and the hammer which strikes it. A hollow ball of brass will
produce more sound, because it is elastic; but still very little
effect will arise from this, since a ball is the worst shape for
admitting of vibration, on account of its forming an arch or dome, in
every direction, so that one part stiffens and sustains the
<span class='pageno' title='273' id='Page_273'></span>other; but if such a ball be divided, and the edge of one half of it struck,
a loud, clear, and distinct tone will be produced; because a
hemisphere will admit of the exertion of elasticity, or of momentary
change of figure, which is conducive to the perfection of sound; and
accordingly the bells used for clocks, and for musical purposes, have
generally such a figure.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I see clearly,” said Louisa, “that it is the vibration of a sonorous
body that communicates the necessary motions to the air; and I suppose
that a body vibrates in proportion to its elasticity.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Certainly it does: but to render this subject still more
intelligible, I have prepared a diagram.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour then exhibited a figure, of which the annexed is a copy,
and proceeded to explain it in the following manner:--</p>

<div  class='figcenter id026'>
<img src='images/figp290.png' alt='Diagram of a string vibrating.' class='ig026' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>“You are well aware that an elastic body, after having been struck,
not only returns to its former situation, but having acquired momentum
by its velocity, like the pendulum or swing,<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c017'><sup>[54]</sup></a> springs out on the
opposite side. If, then, I draw the string <b><span class='fss'>A B</span></b>, which is made fast at
both ends, to <b><span class='fss'>C</span></b>, it will not only return to its original position, but
proceed onwards to <b><span class='fss'>D</span></b>. This is the first vibration, at the end of which
it will retain sufficient velocity to bring it to <b><span class='fss'>E</span></b>, and back again to
<b><span class='fss'>F</span></b>, which constitutes its second vibration; the third vibration will
carry it only to <b><span class='fss'>G</span></b> and <b><span class='fss'>H</span></b>, and so on, till the resistance of the air
destroys its motion.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='274' id='Page_274'></span>“That is exactly like the swing or pendulum,” said Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“As you are struck with the resemblance, take care and preserve the
remembrance of it; for I shall, hereafter, have occasion to revert to
it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“As I now understand how sound is produced and carried to a distance,
I should much like to learn the cause of different tones,” said
Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Fond as you are of music, my dear Louisa, I am not surprised at the
wish you have just expressed to become acquainted with the nature of
musical sounds; I shall, therefore, endeavour to convey, in as simple
a manner as possible, the theory which has been proposed for their
explanation. I think you will immediately perceive that, if the aërial
waves which I have endeavoured to describe, should be irregular, or
run into each other, there must arise a confusion of sounds; thus
<i>discords</i> may be readily imagined to be produced whenever a second
vibration shall commence before the first is finished, so as to meet
it half-way on its return, and interrupt it in its course. In like
manner may we conceive the general nature of those arrangements upon
which <i>unison</i> and <i>concord</i> depend: where the vibrations are
performed in equal times, the same tone is produced by both, and they
are said to be <i>in unison</i>; but <i>concord</i>, as you well know, is not
confined to unison, for two different tones harmonize in a variety of
cases. If, for example the particles of one sonorous body vibrate in
double the time of another, the second vibration of the latter will
strike the ear at the same instant as the first vibration of the
former; and this is the ‘concord of an <i>octave</i>.’ When the vibrations
are as 2 to 3, the coincidence will be at every third vibration of the
quickest, which, therefore, is the next degree of perfection, and is
called a ‘<i>diapente</i>,’ or ‘fifth;’ while the vibration of 3 to 4 will
produce the ‘<i>diatessaron</i>,’ or ‘fourth;’ but this, and the next which
follow in order, are not so agreeable
<span class='pageno' title='275' id='Page_275'></span>to the judicious ear, and are therefore called ‘<i>imperfect concords</i>.’”</p>

<p class='c016'>Louisa here enquired whether the difference in the acuteness of a
sound did not depend upon the nature of the vibrations; and her
father, in reply, stated that it depended entirely upon the degree of
quickness with which the vibrations were performed: the slower the
vibration, the graver the tone; the quicker, the more acute.<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c017'><sup>[55]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c016'>“But, if I strike any one note of the instrument repeatedly, whether
quickly or slowly, it always gives the same tone,” observed Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“To understand that fact,” replied her father, “you must remember that
the vibrations of bodies are regulated by laws very similar to those
of the pendulum; consequently the duration of the vibrations of
strings or chords depends upon their length, and thickness; for if two
strings of equal magnitude, but with their lengths as 2 to 1, be
equally stretched, their vibrations will be in the same ratio;
therefore the shortest will make two vibrations, while the longest
makes one: but the vibrations of the same string will always be the
same whether it be struck quickly or slowly, upon the principle of the
<i>isochronous</i> property of the pendulum, already described.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Upon my word, Mr. Seymour,” cried Mr. Twaddleton, “you are getting
out of your depth; pray let us take leave of this subject, for I am
quite sure that my young friends have already received more than they
can carry away.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I submit, my good sir; and in return for my compliance,” said Mr.
Seymour, “use your influence over Miss Villers, and induce her to
favour us with a practical illustration of our subject upon the
piano-forte.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='276' id='Page_276'></span>“Most cheerfully; but my intercession is quite unnecessary, for I am
sure that our fair friend is no disciple of Tigellius.”<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c017'><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c016'>“I am ever ready, sir, to comply with the wishes of those I respect. I
consider the caprice which our sex too often displays upon these
occasions, as not only a breach of good manners, but an evidence of
unpardonable vanity.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Pray, Miss Villers, may I be allowed to ask whether you have ever
directed your enquiries into the nature of ancient music? it must have
been very superior to that of modern ages,” said Mr. Twaddleton.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Upon a question of such doubt and difficulty, I feel that it would
ill become a person of my very limited knowledge to offer an opinion;
although I am willing to confess that the subject has often engaged my
attention; and you could not afford me a greater gratification than by
clearing up some of those doubts which have perplexed me. It is, I
believe, admitted, that we are unable to ascertain the real nature of
ancient music: but it is evident that it was an art with which mankind
was extremely delighted; for not only the poets, but the historians
and philosophers, of the best ages of Greece and Rome, are as diffuse
in its praises, as of those arts concerning which sufficient remains
have descended to evince the truth of their panegyrics.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Nothing, as you very justly observe, is now left us, but conjecture,”
said the vicar; “and yet it is impossible to read the accounts of the
extraordinary effects produced by the different ‘modes’ of ancient
music, without entertaining a strong conviction of its great
superiority over that of modern times. What have we, my dear Miss
Villers, to compare with the soft ‘<i>Lydian</i>,’ the grave ‘<i>Dorian</i>,’ or
the furious ‘<i>Phrygian</i>;’ to say nothing of the subaltern modes
<span class='pageno' title='277' id='Page_277'></span>of Aristides Quintilianus and others; such, for example, as the
‘<i>erotic</i>,’ ‘<i>comic</i>,’ and ‘<i>encomiastic</i>?’ What modern strains can
produce the effects which are recorded to have followed the
performance of Timotheus, the director of the music of Alexander the
Great? One day, while the prince was at table, the musician performed
an air in the Phrygian mode, which made such an impression on him,
that, being already heated with wine, he flew to his arms, and was
going to attack his guests, had not Timotheus immediately changed the
style of his performance to the sub-Phrygian, or Lydian. This mode
calmed the impetuous fury of the monarch, and induced him to resume
his place at table. Music,” continued the vicar, “has, in modern
times, so fallen from this degree of majesty and power, as to induce
some persons to doubt the truth of the historical statements.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I confess, Mr. Twaddleton,” said Miss Villers, “that I have always
been inclined to regard ancient music as the mere vehicle of poetry;
and to attribute to the power of the latter that influence which you
appear to refer exclusively to the former.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I am willing to admit,” replied the vicar, “that in the ancient
theatre, music always accompanied her sister science, assisting,
animating, and supporting her; in short, that she was, in all
respects, her friend and fellow labourer. ‘<i>Qualem decet esse
sororem</i>,’ as the poet has it: but does not this rather prove that
poetry, in itself, was insufficient to produce its effects without the
aid of music? In farther proof of the power of ancient music, permit
me to remind you that Plato has said, ‘No change can be made in music
without affecting the constitution of the state;’ and Aristotle, who
seems to have written his Politics only to oppose the sentiments of
Plato, nevertheless agrees with him, concerning the power which music
has over mortals; and has not the judicious Polybius told us that
music was necessary to soften the manners
<span class='pageno' title='278' id='Page_278'></span>of the Arcadians? In short, madam, music has lost its power over the
passions of mankind, and this can only have happened in consequence of
its having degenerated from its ancient purity and grandeur. If any
one should have the hardihood to deny this my position, let him attend
a modern rout in London. I have seen, my dear Miss Villers, a party at
a whist-table, a dozen persons in <i>tête-à-têtes</i>, and as many solitary
individuals, sitting like automatons, not one of them being moved by
the concord of sweet sounds, with which some lady has been
endeavouring to delight them. Had Timotheus appeared amongst them!
hey, Miss Villers? I think I see the party at the whist-table, as his
lyre successively changed from the Lydian to the Phrygian mode. I
must, however, in justice state, that I once did see a lady lay down
her cards in an apparent state of ecstasy, as a chorus of Handel
suddenly burst upon her ear.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And what might that chorus have been?” said Mr. Seymour, “‘<i>Blest be
the hand?</i>’ But, joking apart, you appear to have satisfied your mind
upon a point which all the learning of Europe has left in a state of
doubt and perplexity.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I have merely delivered an opinion, sir; you perhaps will favour us
with your judgment.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The subject under discussion, my good sir, is one upon which no
person can ever deliver a judgment.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And pray, Mr. Seymour, why not?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“For this plain reason, that it is not possible we can <i>hear</i> both
sides.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Psha! will you never cease to sully the pure stream of enquiry with
the dregs of ridicule?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well, then, to be serious; I agree with Miss Villers, that ancient
music, whatever might have been its powers, was wholly indebted to the
poetry which accompanied it for its influence over the feelings of
mankind. It could not have been otherwise. The ancient instruments, as
represented in sculpture,
<span class='pageno' title='279' id='Page_279'></span>appear so simple as to be apparently incapable of producing great
effects; and, indeed, amongst the writings of Aristoxenus, the oldest
musical author, we cannot discover a trace of melody or harmony, such
as we understand by <i>air</i> accompanied with different parts.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“To that very simplicity am I disposed to refer the charm of ancient
music,” said the vicar; “it was addressed to the <i>ear</i>, sir, whereas
modern music is addressed to the <i>eye</i>; dexterity of execution is,
now-a-days, more valued than beauty of composition; the sweetest
shepherd that ever piped on his Doric reed, would be less applauded
than he who can make his pipe squeak for the space of five minutes
without respiration. The ancients knew better than to suffer the
energy and accentuation of their rhythm to be so destroyed; and only
mark, sir, the extreme jealousy with which they regarded every attempt
to injure this simplicity; it even became a subject of legislation;
and you no doubt remember the decree issued against Timotheus; which,
as well as I recollect, ran thus, ‘Whereas Timotheus the Milesian,
coming to our city, has dishonoured our ancient music, and despising
the lyre of seven strings, has, by the introduction of a greater
variety of notes, corrupted the ears of our youth; and, by the number
of his strings and the novelty of his melody, has given to our music
an effeminate and artificial dress, instead of the plain and orderly
one in which it has hitherto appeared; rendering melody infamous, by
composing in the chromatic, instead of the enharmonic. The kings and
the ephori have, therefore, resolved to pass censure upon Timotheus
for these things; and farther, to oblige him to cut all the
superfluous strings of his <i>eleven</i>, leaving only the <i>seven</i> tones,
and to banish him from our city, that men may be warned for the future
not to introduce into Sparta any unbecoming customs.’”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='280' id='Page_280'></span>“And now, my dear vicar, have you done? Have you said all you think
necessary, in defence of ancient music? If so, hear me, as the
advocate of modern harmony. In the first place, there is not an
anecdote which can be adduced in support of your side of the question,
that may not be met with one parallel, and equally strong, in defence
of mine. You cite the authority of Plato, to show that the
constitution of a state may be affected by changing its national
music. What said the great Lord Chatham?--‘<i>Give me the making of the
national ballads, and I care not who makes the laws</i>;’ and the effects
produced on the English people by Dibdin’s songs, fully justified the
maxim: but remember Mr. Twaddleton, it was not the music, but the
<i>poetry</i> of those songs, which kindled the patriotic feelings which
saved our country; and I apprehend that this has been the case in all
ages, where the power of music has been said to excite the feelings of
the populace. We know that the ancient bards of our own country called
forth the emotions of their hearers by the poetry of their songs; and
with what success they practised their calling we may imagine from the
fact that Edward the First, in his conquest of Wales, had recourse to
the barbarous expedient of murdering all the bards, from the many
obstacles they threw in his way, by the strong hold which they had
over the minds of the people. You have told us a story of Timotheus,
and the influence of his harp over a drunken monarch. If this is
adduced in proof of the power of ancient music, you must, at least,
admit that modern times have also had a Timotheus, who could excite or
calm, at his pleasure, the most impetuous emotions. Henry III. king of
France, says ‘<i>Le Journal de Sancy</i>,’ having given a concert on
occasion of the marriage of the Duke de Joyeuse, Claudin le Jeune, a
celebrated musician of that period, executed certain airs, which had
such an effect on a young
<span class='pageno' title='281' id='Page_281'></span>nobleman, that he drew his sword, and challenged every one near him to
combat; but Claudin, equally prudent as Timotheus, instantly changed
to an air, <i>sub-Phrygian</i>, or <i>Lydian</i>, I suppose, which appeased the
furious youth. But what shall we say of Stradella, the celebrated
composer, whose music made the daggers drop from the hands of his
assassins? Stradella was attacked by three desperadoes, who had been
hired to assassinate him; but, fortunately, they had an ear sensible
to harmony. While waiting for a favourable opportunity to execute
their purpose they entered the church of St. John de Lateran, during
the performance of an oratorio, composed by the person whom they
intended to destroy, and were so affected by the music, that they
abandoned their design, and even waited on the musician to apprise him
of his danger. Stradella, however, was not always so fortunate; other
assassins, who apparently had no ear for music, stabbed him some time
afterwards at Genoa.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And thus afforded a practical illustration of a passage of
Shakspeare,” exclaimed the vicar,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c043'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<b>‘The man that hath no music in himself,</b></div>
      <div class='line'><b>Nor is not mov’d with concord of sweet sounds,</b></div>
      <div class='line'><b>Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils;</b></div>
      <div class='line'><b>The motions of his spirit are dull as night,</b></div>
      <div class='line'><b>And his affections dark as Erebus:</b></div>
      <div class='line'><b>Let no such man be trusted.’</b>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“Are you satisfied?” asked Mr. Seymour; “if not, I will proceed to
tell you how Palma, a Neapolitan, induced a creditor who came to
arrest him, not only to remit his debt, but to contribute a sum for
his support. I will also relate an anecdote of Farinelli the actor,
who having a pathetic air to sing on the stage to a tyrant who had
taken him prisoner, the person who performed the part of the tyrant,
and was to have refused his request, was so affected by
<span class='pageno' title='282' id='Page_282'></span>the music, that he actually melted into tears, and clasped the captive in
his arms.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Enough, enough!” exclaimed the vicar. “I see plainly that you believe
not in the power of music.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“In that you wrong me. I certainly do not believe that the ancients
were better skilled than ourselves in music; and I have been anxious
to convince you that there are as many modern as ancient stories, in
proof of the influence of harmony over our feelings; but no one will
deny that music is capable of producing extraordinary effects. Let us
only interrogate ourselves, and examine what have been our sensations
on hearing a majestic or warlike piece of music, or a tender and
pathetic air sung or played with expression. Who does not feel that
the latter tends as much to melt the soul and dispose it to pleasure,
as the former to animate and exalt it? There is a celebrated air in
Switzerland, which, I have no doubt, Miss Villers will presently play
to us, called ‘<i>Rans des Vaches</i>,’ and which had such an extraordinary
effect on the Swiss troops in the French service, that they always
fell into a deep melancholy whenever they heard it. Louis XIV,
therefore, forbade it ever to be played in France, under the pain of a
severe penalty. We are also told of a Scotch air, ‘<i>Lochaber no
more</i>,’ which had a similar effect on the natives of Scotland. Never
shall I forget the effect produced upon myself by the impressive
requiem of Jomelli, as performed at the chapel of the Portuguese
embassy to the memory of the late king of Portugal. The movement with
which it commenced was a deep and hollow murmur, that seemed to swell
from the tomb, and with which the voices of spirits imperceptibly
rose, and intermingled;--a brilliant movement interposed,--it was a
ray of hope that pierced the gloom of the sepulchre!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I think,” said Miss Villers, “that I can exactly appreciate the
nature and extent of Mr. Seymour’s
<span class='pageno' title='283' id='Page_283'></span>opinion upon the question at issue. He does not deny the charm which
the simple music of the ancients must have exercised over the hearer,
although he attributes much of the effect to the poetry, of which it
may certainly be said to have been the vehicle; and he evidently
concurs with you, Mr. Twaddleton, in thinking that, owing to the
intricate combinations of modern harmony, our astonishment at the
execution of the artist too frequently overcomes the influence of the
musical tones upon our passions. I perceive, however, from the
expression of our friend’s countenance,” continued the young lady,
“that, like a true antiquary, he clings to his subject, though his
support be no stronger than a cobweb; under such circumstances I may
be permitted to declare my sentiments upon the occasion, and I shall
avail myself of this opportunity to express my humble testimony of
gratitude, for the information and pleasure which I have just derived
from your conversation. I believe then, gentlemen, that the language
of modern music is no less forcible and expressive than that of
ancient days; and if you will only allow me to exemplify this truth by
an experiment, I feel convinced that the vicar will become my
proselyte.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Indeed, madam! Well, I will consent to trust the cause in your
hands,” said Mr. Twaddleton.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Allow me then to ask you, sir, whether you have ever heard of a game,
which is justly entitled to the appellation of the <span class='sc'>Magic of Music</span>?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Never,” replied the vicar; “nor can I imagine either the nature, or
objects of such a game.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Its object is to display the power of music as an expressive
language; the manner in which I propose to exemplify it, I will, with
your permission, explain in a few words. The musical performer shall
place herself at the harp, or piano-forte, surrounded by the party who
are desirous of witnessing the pastime; the person to be operated upon
must retire
<span class='pageno' title='284' id='Page_284'></span>from the apartment, until the service which, under the direction of the
music, it is determined he shall perform, is duly agreed upon and
arranged. Such person is then to be re-admitted; not a word, look, or
gesture, is to escape from any one present; by the expression of the
music alone is he to receive his instructions, and, unless I am much
deceived, you will find that this is amply sufficient for the
purpose.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“My dear madam, the thing is utterly impossible,” exclaimed the vicar.
“It cannot be done; unless, indeed, you really possess the secret of
the ancient ‘<i>modes</i>,’ which were not even known to Meibomius, the
learned commentator upon the Greek musician Alypius; nay, Isaac
Vossius himself, the expounder of rhythm, were he now alive, would
never credit it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Are you willing to make the experiment,” said Miss Villers; “if so,
be so kind as to leave the room for a few minutes.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The vicar accordingly prepared to depart, casting at the same time,
upon his fair companion, a look which sufficiently expressed the
scepticism he felt upon the occasion.</p>

<p class='c016'>“But you have not told me,” said he, “by what signal I am to return,
and submit to the proposed ordeal.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The music will inform you, if you pay sufficient attention to its
language,” replied Miss Villers.</p>

<p class='c016'>The door having been carefully closed, the company were consulted, in
a whisper, as to the service they should require the vicar to perform.
“I should propose,” said Miss Villers, “that Mr. Twaddleton be
directed to take a rose out of the basket of flowers on the
chimney-piece, and having smelt it, to carry it to the harp.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And do you propose to express all these different movements by the
aid of music? If you succeed, there must be an end to the vicar’s
scepticism,” observed Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='285' id='Page_285'></span>“If I fail upon this occasion, it will be the first time,” said Miss
Villers: “but you must all promise to be silent, and to maintain the
most absolute command over your countenances.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Miss Villers seated herself at the piano-forte, and played off an
elegant and sparkling overture, which so delighted Mrs. Seymour that
she involuntarily exclaimed, “If music can be made to speak an
intelligible language, it must be under the guidance of Miss Villers.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Hush,” cried the performer, in a half whisper: “I am now about to
summon the vicar into the room, and we must be as silent as
Carthusians.”</p>

<p class='c016'>She accordingly, with exquisite taste and address, introduced the air
of “<i>Open the door, Lord Gregory</i>,” into which she infused so much
expression, that the vicar must have been as dull as Midas had he not
instantly caught its meaning. Nor were the lady’s hopes disappointed.
Mr. Twaddleton entered, and appeared as if anxious to address the
performer; but an intelligible glance from Mr. Seymour recalled him to
his duty, and hermetically sealed his lips. His intention had been,
doubtless, to enquire whether his appearance were seasonable; but the
question was anticipated by Miss Villers, who immediately on his
entrance struck up the air of “<i>See the conquering Hero comes</i>,”
which, at once, satisfied his doubts, and conveyed, in language not to
be misunderstood, the sanction of the enchantress, to whose spells he
had so unreservedly intrusted himself.</p>

<p class='c016'>The vicar had been told that he was to perform certain acts on his
re-admission into the room; but, thought he, how am I to discover the
thread which is to guide me through so perplexing a maze? I can
discover at this moment nothing but a concord of sweet sounds, that
would rather dispose me to listen in profound repose, than to enter
upon any service of exertion. Miss Villers saw and guessed the nature
<span class='pageno' title='286' id='Page_286'></span>of his embarrassment, and changing the melody, struck into the air of
“<i>Hearken and I will tell thee how</i>.” She then, by a succession of
well-selected chords, which were now played ‘<i>piano</i>,’ and now
‘<i>forte</i>,’ convinced the vicar that she commanded an instrument fully
capable of readily and forcibly expressing encouragement and repulse
in all its degrees.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Thus much then is certain,” mentally ejaculated the vicar, “that she
is enabled, by the aid of music, to signify her approbation, or
disapprobation, of any act which I may attempt to perform. I
accordingly predicate of this said music, that it is, <i>bonâ fide</i>, a
logical weapon; inasmuch as it can affirm and deny. It, therefore,
only remains for me, knowing as I do that I have some act to perform,
to ascertain the ‘<i>locus</i>’ or ‘<i>ubi</i>,’ for the act in question,
whatever it may be, must of necessity be done or accomplished ‘<i>in
proprio loco</i>,’ or in some definite part of the room.” With this
determination, founded, as he believed it to be, on the unerring basis
of Aristotelian logic, he advanced towards the table; but the loud and
discordant sounds of the instrument at once convinced him, that,
however correct his notions might be with reference to the
‘<i>substance</i>’ or first ‘<i>predicament</i>,’ they were evidently erroneous
as to the ‘<i>accidents</i>,’ of ‘time,’ ‘place,’ and ‘relation;’ at least,
such were the ideas that floated through the categorical organ of his
cranium, and he accordingly faced about, and made a retreat towards
the window; but the notes now became still more clamorous, and
increased in vehemence. Ay, ay, thought he, it is quite evident that I
am receding from the theatre of action; and with this conviction he
diverted his steps into a different direction, and, in a slow pace,
tracked the path by his ear, with as much sagacity as a dog follows
his prey by his nose. As he approached the fire-place, the storm of
sounds gradually subsided,
<span class='pageno' title='287' id='Page_287'></span>until a peaceful murmur breathed around, which finally died away as the
vicar placed his hand upon the chimney-piece. So then it appears,
after all, that I have some service to perform at the fire-side. It
is, doubtless, to sit down, thought he, as he espied the elbow-chair,
which, at that moment, appeared to his fancy, as if stretching forth
its hospitable arms to receive him; but scarcely had he answered the
imaginary invitation of his old friend, by presenting the nether part
of his person to its luxurious lap of down, than a sudden <i>sforzato</i>,
or crash in the minor key, made him rebound upon his legs, as nimbly
as though the cushion had been a bed of thorns. Miss Villers now
resolved the discord, and dexterously dashed into an allegro movement,
in which she introduced the air of “<i>How sweet are the flowers that
grow!</i>”</p>

<p class='c016'>The vicar’s face mantled with a smile, as the bouquet on the
chimney-piece met his eye, and harmonised with the sounds that floated
in his ear. It is evident, thought he, that those flowers are the
objects of my pursuit,--but what was he to do with them? The musician
solved the question, by tastefully exchanging the former air for that
of “<i>Ask if yon damask rose be sweet</i>.” No sooner had these notes
delivered their melodious errand to the subtle ear of the vicar, than
he instantly seized the rose, and carried it in triumph to his
olfactory organs; at the same moment the music ceased. The pause,
however, was but of short duration; for Miss Villers, by resuming her
labours, intimated that some farther service was expected. Was he to
return the rose? Certainly not; for the attempt was marked by strong
disapprobation. Was he to take it out of the room? The music put a
decided negative upon that movement; for the vicar had scarcely
measured half the distance of the apartment before the air of “<i>Fly
not yet</i>” arrested his steps. By a continuation of the
<span class='pageno' title='288' id='Page_288'></span>same varying style of expression, and strongly marked rhythm, the
vicar was shortly led to affix the rose upon the harp.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Upon my word,” exclaimed the vicar, “I shall no longer hesitate to
credit the story related in ‘Peter Simple,’ of a certain lady who
played so exquisitely, that upon introducing an imitation of thunder,
the cream for tea became sour, besides three casks of beer in the
cellar!”</p>

<p class='c016'>In closing our account of this interesting scene, it is scarcely
necessary to describe the delight and mirth of the juvenile party. It
was, in truth, a very extraordinary exhibition; and when the reader
considers that, beyond what was furnished by the expressive language
of music, the vicar did not receive a single hint for his guidance, he
may, perhaps, cherish some scepticism upon the subject; but we can
assure him that we have repeatedly witnessed, not only a similar but a
still more complicated performance of the same kind, and with equal
success.<a href='#note45'>(45)</a></p>

<p class='c016'>The evening of the day on which this musical divertisement was
performed, was one of those which so frequently occur in August, when
sultry heat is succeeded by refreshing coolness. Isabella Villers
possessed a quick sensibility to the beauties of nature, and she
quitted the drawing-room to enjoy, without interruption, that pensive
quiet which maintained an undisputed dominion. The moon had but just
risen, tipping the summits of the wood with silver, while it left the
mass of foliage in deeper shadow. Never was there a fairy scene better
calculated to awaken the emotions of the heart, or to kindle the
energies of the imagination. The hour too was propitious to the
indulgence of that undefined species of reverie which is the
refinement of intellectual pleasure. Having traversed the winding path
of the wood for some distance, she found herself in one of those
sequestered glades we have formerly described. She
<span class='pageno' title='289' id='Page_289'></span>seated herself on a rustic bench, tastefully formed out of an aged
oak, whose venerable figure was bending under the hand of Time, and
her mind was gratefully lulled into a pensive calm by the review of
past events, as the ear is soothed by the murmur of wild and distant
music. A sudden breath of wind, as it swept the foliage, aroused her
from her reverie, and turned the current of her ideas from past scenes
to future prospects. The moon, as if in sympathy, suddenly peered
through the sylvan avenue, and threw her rays upon one of those
statues which we have already described as giving such an air of
classic sanctity to these secluded glades. It was the figure of <span class='sc'>Time</span>,
which in the gloom of the wood had hitherto escaped her observation.
To a mind of exuberant fancy, a leaf cannot fall to the ground, nor a
zephyr waft the fragrance of the violet on its dewy pinions, without
conveying some beautiful emblem of morality. Isabella rose from her
seat, and approached the figure, whose hoary countenance appeared as
if lighted up into a placid smile by the beams of the moon, which fell
directly upon it; her eye glanced from his face to his scythe; its
blade was hidden in a cluster of roses--Were I susceptible of a
superstitious impression, thought Isabella, did ever a circumstance
present itself better calculated to justify its indulgence? On the
pedestal of the figure was a basso relievo, in which Time appeared in
the act of shivering into pieces the club of Hercules with a crutch.
In a few minutes, she quitted the scene, which, in spite of her better
reason, she could not wholly divest of its prophetic influence, and
proceeding along the winding path, at length descended into the
valley. The moon was at this time shrouded in dark clouds, and
although, by a painful effort, Isabella Villers summoned all the
powers of her vision, the objects around her remained invisible, until
the eye had so far accommodated itself to the gloom, as to recognise
the
<span class='pageno' title='290' id='Page_290'></span>white foam of the waterfall. The moon now gave a coy and furtive glance, the
water for an instant sparkled in her beams, and then was lost in
deeper shadow. A spectre of human form, but of gigantic stature, arose
from the spot to which the eyes of Isabella had been directed--was it
the spirit of the Fountain? It appeared to advance, but the moon once
again shining forth in splendour, it vanished.</p>

</div>

<p class='c016'>The courage of Isabella was destined to sustain another trial, for
scarcely had the vision disappeared than she distinctly heard her own
name pronounced; and since, from the direction of the sound, she well
knew that the spot from which it issued was inaccessible, we ought not
to feel surprised at her having at the instant referred it to a
supernatural origin--it was, however, but the illusion of the moment,
and she determined to return to the house and submit the events of the
evening to the judgment of Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>We shall not trespass any longer upon the patience of the reader, than
to state that Miss Villers arrived safely at the lodge, and very
shortly afterwards retired to rest. With your permission, gentle
reader, we will follow her example; for, to say the truth, our
lamp--that midnight sun which illumines the path of the author, is
dimmed by the dark clouds that lower at its setting; our Pegasus, the
pen, which has raced for so many hours over the snowy plains of
foolscap, is fairly “done up,” and refuses any longer to sip of that
spring which can alone sustain its powers, and impart utility to its
movements.</p>

<p class='c024'>On entering the library on the following morning, Mr. Seymour informed
Miss Villers, that Major Snapwell had taken his departure, in order to
breakfast with the vicar, and that he had invited Tom and Louisa to
accompany him, for the sake of inspecting the cabinet of medals; but
he added, that he expected the return of the party at two o’clock,
when he proposed to give them a lecture upon the philosophy of the
several toys which are indebted for their action to atmospheric
vibrations.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Suppose, then,” said Miss Villers, “that we walk towards Forest Lane,
and meet them on their return. This arrangement,” she added, “will
afford me an opportunity of communicating to you the history of some
adventures I encountered last evening, and of taking your opinion upon
them.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You well know,” answered Mr. Seymour, “that you may always command my
services--but you have really raised my curiosity: what can be the
nature of the adventures you speak of?”</p>

<p class='c016'>Miss Villers then entered into a particular account of all she saw and
heard the preceding evening; with which the reader is already
acquainted. Mr.
<span class='pageno' title='292' id='Page_292'></span>Seymour, however, suggested the propriety of abstaining from any discussion
upon the subject until the children were present to hear it; for, said
he, “I am most desirous that they should be familiarized with those
natural sources of illusion which enlighten the wise, while they
minister to the superstitious fears of the ignorant.”</p>

<p class='c016'>They had not reached the entrance of Forest Lane, before they
perceived the vicar with Tom and Louisa, followed by the Major.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Papa,” cried Tom, as he ran to meet his father, “we have had a most
delightful morning; amongst other things, do you know we have found
out the meaning of the crescent which the Turks always wear, and use
as their ensign.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Indeed! well, then, let me hear your explanation,” said his father.</p>

<p class='c016'>Major Snapwell and the vicar had by this time joined the party, and
with their assistance Tom was enabled to offer the following account
of it.--The crescent appears on the early coins of Byzantium, and was
intended to commemorate the defeat of Philip of Macedon, who, as he
was about to storm it on a cloudy night, was discovered by the sudden
light of the moon. When the Turks entered Constantinople, they found
this ancient badge in various parts of the city, and suspecting that
it might possess some magical power, they assumed the symbol and its
power to themselves; so that the crescent became, and still continues
to be, the chief Turkish ensign.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well, I must own that you have given me a new and very curious piece
of historical information, and I thank you for it,” said Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Medals, then, are occasionally of some little use,” remarked the
vicar, with a sarcastic smile; for if the truth must be told, the
reverend antiquary had been a little nettled as usual by the freedom
with which
<span class='pageno' title='293' id='Page_293'></span>Major Snapwell had criticised some of his rarities; but let that pass.</p>

<p class='c016'>As soon as the party reassembled after the excursion of the morning,
the circumstances which so greatly astonished Miss Villers on the
preceding evening, were again related by her.</p>

<p class='c016'>“My dear young lady,” observed Mr. Seymour, “I never heard a better
story for illustrating the illusions to which the senses are exposed;
and if you will read the second letter on ‘Natural Magic,’ by Sir
David Brewster, you will obtain a ready explanation of your
vision--but let us examine it philosophically. In the first place you
acknowledge that your imagination had been previously excited during
your ramble through the wood, and more especially by your reverie at
the statue of Time; now it is well known that such a condition of the
mind prepares and adapts the organs of vision for those illusions
which I am about to explain. You have told us that, on your descent
into the valley, the moon had withdrawn its light, and several minutes
had elapsed before an object became visible, and that was the <i>white</i>
foam of the waterfall.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“If I rightly remember, Brewster has stated that the spectres that are
conjured up by the imagination are always <i>white</i>, because no other
colour can be seen at night,” observed Mrs. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Undoubtedly,” replied her husband; “and as these spectres are formed
out of objects whose different parts reflect different degrees of
light, their fainter parts will appear and disappear with the ever
varying degree of illumination which is occasioned by the moon shining
through a veil of clouds, and a change even of shape will be thus
produced which will impart to the object in question the semblance of
a living form. The actual state of the eye itself will also greatly
assist in completing such an illusion;
<span class='pageno' title='294' id='Page_294'></span>for, in consequence of the small degree of light, the pupil expands to
nearly the whole width of the iris, in order to collect every ray, and
in such a condition it cannot accommodate itself to see near objects
distinctly, so that the form of a body actually becomes more shadowy
and confused when it comes within the very distance at which we count
upon obtaining the best view of it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You have certainly explained the reason why bodies seen under a faint
illumination may appear distorted and caricatured; indeed, I now
remember that Sir Walter Scott, in his “Pirate,” has given us a very
good illustration; for Cleveland when abandoned on Coffin bay is said
to have seen many a dim and undefined spectre in the misty dawn. But I
am still at a loss to understand how the vision I witnessed in the
valley could have been conjured up,” said Miss Villers.</p>

<p class='c016'>“It was the doubtful and flickering light of the clouded moon upon the
mass of white sandstone,” said Mr. Seymour. “It is a great law of the
imagination, that a likeness in part tends to become a likeness of the
whole. The sandstone presented, in the first instance, a form somewhat
resembling the human figure, or some part of it, when your active
imagination immediately completed the outline; just in the same way as
we trace images in the fire, or castles in the clouds, or grotesque
figures of men and animals on damp walls.”<a href='#note46'>(46)</a></p>

<p class='c016'>“I am satisfied,” said Miss Villers, “and I thank you, and Sir David
Brewster, for the lecture; and now,” continued the lady, “how will you
explain the circumstance of my name having been so audibly pronounced,
and from a spot which made it impossible that it should have come from
any human being?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It was the solitary spirit of the dell,” said Mr. Seymour, with a
smile; “a rural spirit who is disposed to become very loquacious
whenever the repose
<span class='pageno' title='295' id='Page_295'></span>of her habitation is disturbed. I can assure you,” added he, “that you are
not the first person whom her gambols have surprised and terrified in
the shades of evening. I presume you have discovered that I allude to
that unseen musician of the air--<span class='fss'>ECHO</span>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Indeed, Mr. Seymour, the sound could not have been the effect of an
echo, for I never spoke,” replied Miss Villers.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Very likely, but I happen to know that Mrs. Seymour called you by
name at the orchard gate.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Nor will that explain it,” observed Miss Villers, “for in that case I
must certainly have heard her, whereas the sound came in a very
different direction, from the inaccessible rocks of sandstone.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Young lady,” said Mr. Seymour, “you must forgive me for telling you
that your philosophy is at fault. It is as possible to hear an echo,
without recognising the direct sound which produced it, as it is for
two persons to be so placed as to see each other in a looking-glass,
although objects might obstruct the direct view of themselves. Did you
never walk between an irregular wall and a row of houses, or along a
valley intercepted by houses during the ringing of a peal of bells?
Nothing is more common under such circumstances, for the sound instead
of arriving at the ear, in its true direction, to be reflected in one
that is opposite to it;--now before we quit the subject of optical
illusion, let me relate an incident which occurred to myself. I
presume you are all acquainted with the appearance in the grass,
called a <i>Fairy-ring</i>?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“To be sure,” said Tom, “a very dark circle of grass, around which
there is generally a ring that looks as if the ground had been burnt.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Very well,--and we are now satisfied that this appearance is the
consequence of the growth and decay of certain fungi<a href='#note47'>(47)</a>, although the
common people still believe that the ring is produced by the
<span class='pageno' title='296' id='Page_296'></span>gambols of fairies--now then for my story. It was on a moonlight night, last
August, when strolling along a neighbouring meadow, enjoying the
beauties of the evening, that I met a young farmer, an intelligent
person, although a little inclined to a belief in the marvellous, who,
on approaching with a hasty step, thus accosted me;--‘You have often
ridiculed my belief in fairies, and of their being the cause of those
rings which go by their name; you may now, if you please, satisfy
yourself of their reality, if you will only return with me to the elm
close, which, as you know, abounds with fairy-rings. Within the last
few minutes I have actually seen them at their gambols under the great
elm; they are, sir, tiny beings which, as far as I could judge at a
distance, cannot be more than a few inches in height; but there they
are, frisking away most merrily: pray, sir, do let us return, and
satisfy yourself as well as me.’--You may readily suppose that I lost
no time in complying with my friend’s request; and sure enough there
they were.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“What, the fairies!” exclaimed Louisa, in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Have patience, my dear, and you shall hear. I confess,” continued Mr.
Seymour, “that at the first glance, I was almost startled into a
belief in the reality of my friend’s assertion, but on approaching,
the Fairy Queen and her court were changed into a circle of fungi, to
which the shadowy play of the leaves of the neighbouring tree had, in
the light of the moon, given the appearance of a fantastic motion. The
illusion, I will admit, was very extraordinary, and one well
calculated to impose upon the credulous countrymen.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The young party were much amused by the anecdote, and the vicar took
this opportunity to explain, on natural principles, several
superstitious appearances recorded in ancient legends.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='297' id='Page_297'></span>Mr. Seymour now proposed to dedicate an hour to the explanation of the
several toys which owe their action to atmospheric vibration; “I shall
then,” said he, addressing Miss Villers, “be at your service to
interrogate the spirit of the valley; and the children, whom I intend
to accompany us, will be thus better prepared to comprehend the theory
of the echo.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Musical instruments, amongst which I include the toys to which I have
alluded, may be classed under three heads:--<i>stringed</i> instruments,
such as the harp, violin, &amp;c.; <i>wind</i> instruments, as the flute and
trumpet; and instruments of <i>percussion</i>, as the tabor and drum.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And which kind do you consider the most ancient?” asked Miss Villers.</p>

<p class='c016'>“<i>Wind</i> instruments, madam, most unquestionably,” cried Mr.
Twaddleton. “Diodorus ascribed their invention to the accidental
notice of the whistling of the wind in the reeds, on the banks of the
Nile; and the poet Lucretius maintained a similar opinion.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I really, my dear Sir, cannot see any good reason for giving this
preference, in point of antiquity, to wind instruments,” said Mr.
Seymour. “The lyre, or harp, is, surely, as ancient as any instrument
on record. The mythologist ascribes the idea of producing sound by the
vibration of a string, to Apollo; which is said by Censorinus to have
suggested itself to him, on his hearing the twang of the bow of his
sister Diana. With respect to instruments of percussion, it may be
reasonably supposed that the sonorous ringing of hollow bodies, when
struck, must have very soon suggested their invention to mankind; but
I really consider any research into a question of such obscurity as
uninteresting as it must be hopeless; let us rather devote our
attention to the philosophy of these instruments. I have stated that
they may be referred to three principal classes; but I must at the
same time observe that, in some cases, the vibrations
<span class='pageno' title='298' id='Page_298'></span>of solid bodies are made to co-operate with those of a given portion of
air; for example, trumpets and various horns may be said to be mixed
wind instruments, since their sound is produced by the joint
vibrations of the air and a solid body; and in certain stringed
instruments, as in the violin, the immediate effect of the strings is
increased by means of a sounding-board, which appears to be agitated
by their motion, and to act more powerfully on the air than the
strings could have done alone.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I apprehend that this mixture must obtain more or less in all
instruments,” said the vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Not at all. The flute, flageolet, humming-top, and the cavity of the
mouth in whistling, may be considered as simple wind instruments, in
which the quality of the sound is alone determined by the vibrations
of the air. I have already explained the manner in which the
oscillations of a string excite aërial undulations, and thus produce
sound; and you have seen that the nature of these sounds is determined
by the length and thickness of such strings: the theory equally
applies to wind instruments, in which case, a column of air
corresponds with the string, the volume and length of which determines
the sound. In the harp, the strings are constructed of different
lengths and dimensions; and so, in the <i>Syrinx</i>, or <i>Pan’s pipes</i>, is
the volume of air adjusted to the respective notes by the size and
length of the reeds; but, in the violin, the lengths of the strings
are altered at pleasure by pressing them down on the finger-board;
and, in like manner, the effective length of the flute is changed by
the opening or shutting the holes made at proper distances in them;
the opening of a hole at any part being the same in effect as if the
pipe were cut off a little beyond it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour and the vicar then entered into a long discussion, with
which it is not our intention to swell our history, or to exhaust the
patience of the
<span class='pageno' title='299' id='Page_299'></span>reader; we shall, however, with his permission, collect from the mass
some of the more interesting facts, and present them in as condensed a
form as may be consistent with perspicuity. In speaking of the <i>Jew’s
harp</i>, a little instrument with which every school-boy is well
acquainted, the vicar stated that its origin was lost in the long
lapse of time; but that it was in very common use throughout Europe,
and more especially in the Netherlands and the Tyrol, where it was the
delight of the peasants and their families. He also said that it was
known in Asia, and that the Greeks of Smyrna called it, in imitation
of its sound, <i>biambo</i>. The name by which it is now known, he
observed, was evidently derived from the Jews, who were formerly the
great venders of it, and of other toys throughout Europe, although he
stated that his friend Mr. Prybabel was of opinion that it was a
corruption of <i>jaw’s</i> harp. Mr. Seymour described its construction,
and the theory of its action.</p>
<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/figp316.png' alt='Jew’s harp.' class='c035' />
</div>
<p class='c016'>It is composed of two parts, the <i>body</i>
and the <i>tongue</i>: the former has some resemblance to the handle of a
certain kind of corkscrew; the latter consists of a little strip of
steel, joined to the upper part of the body, and bent at its
extremity, so that the fingers may touch it more readily. This tongue,
or elastic plate, produces, in itself, only a sound which serves as a
drone, although it appears to act like the motion of the bow of a
violin in exciting other sounds, by breaking the current of air from
the mouth, the acuteness or gravity of which will be determined by the
pressure of the lips, and the magnitude of the cavity of the mouth. To
understand, however, this part of its operation, it is necessary
<span class='pageno' title='300' id='Page_300'></span>that the reader should become acquainted with the nature and effects of
what have been termed <i>Resonances, and Reciprocated Vibrations of
Columns of Air</i>. This property of sounding bodies, which to the
ignorant must appear as an inexplicable species of sympathy, will be
more fully explained in a note<a href='#note48'>(48)</a>; at present we shall merely give
one or two examples of its effects. A singer has been known to break
into pieces a large tumbler glass by the power of his voice; and a
violin suspended against a wall may be heard to yield the same notes
as those produced by a performer on a similar instrument in the same
room. To produce such an effect, however, one condition is
indispensable, that the body to be put in vibration must be in unison,
or agreeing in pitch, with the one communicating the sound. Hence the
necessity of so adapting the capacity of the mouth in playing the
Jew’s harp, as to make the column of air which it contains to
reciprocate the sound of its tongue. The subject was agreeably
concluded by some anecdotes which were related by Miss Villers, in
proof of the astonishing powers of this little instrument when
directed by the skill of a master. For the sake of those who may be
curious upon this subject we have introduced an account of two great
performers, in an additional note<a href='#note49'>(49)</a>. In speaking of the flute, Mr.
Twaddleton took occasion to observe, that its name was derived from
<i>fluta</i>,<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c017'><sup>[57]</sup></a> a lamprey, or small Sicilian eel, which has seven holes
on each side; an etymology which will probably be as new to our
readers as it was to ourselves. The children also received their share
of instruction and amusement upon this occasion. Tom, for the first
time, became acquainted with the use of the pea in the whistle, which,
he was told, was to agitate and break the current of air, and thus to
produce a succession of quick vibrations upon which the acuteness of
its sound
<span class='pageno' title='301' id='Page_301'></span>depended. Louisa exhibited her <i>whiz-gig</i>, which, for the information of the
unlearned reader, we may state to consist of a hollow disc of wood,
having an opening in its side, like that in the humming-top; by the
alternate coiling and uncoiling of the cord upon which it is strung it
receives a circular motion, the rapidity of which produces, by means
of its opening, an aërial vibration that gives a loud ringing sound.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I should very much like to hear your opinion of that Egyptian wonder,
the statue of Memnon,” said the vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Its history,” answered Mr. Seymour, “is involved in considerable
doubt and difficulty. Authors of credit agree in stating that it
certainly saluted the rising sun with a musical sound; but doubts are
still entertained as to the cause which produced it, whether it was
the effect of mechanism, or a juggle of the Egyptian priests. An
English traveller, Sir A. Smith, informs us that he visited the
statue, and actually heard the sounds at six o’clock in the morning;
but he believes that they proceeded, not from the figure, but from the
pedestal, and he considers that they may arise from the impulse of the
air upon the stones of which it is constructed. Others have supposed
that the heat of the sun’s rays, concentrated by a mirror, may have
acted upon plates of metal so as to produce the effect. It is not my
intention to argue this point; but I will show you an experiment, by
which you will, I think, be convinced that a statue might easily be
constructed like the Memnon to yield musical sounds by the application
of heat, whether derived from the solar rays, or from any other
source.”</p>
<div  class='figcenter id028'>
<img src='images/figp318.png' alt='The “piece of apparatus” described below.' class='ig028' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour produced a piece of apparatus, of which we here present
the reader with a sketch. It
<span class='pageno' title='302' id='Page_302'></span>consists of an oblong block of copper, one surface of which is flat, the other
formed by two planes meeting at an obtuse angle, and having a groove
at the point of junction <b><span class='fss'>A</span></b>. To this block a handle is affixed.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour having thus described the form of the instrument, and
stated that its construction was solely directed with a view of making
it oscillate freely on any plain surface, thrust the block in the
fire, and when sufficiently heated, placed it on its angular surface,
upon a flat piece of lead. It immediately began to vibrate, producing
at first, a kind of singing noise, not unlike that of the simmering of
a teakettle, but the vibrations became more and more rapid until a
distinct musical sound was produced, which from time to time varied in
its pitch, and gave rise to an effect scarcely inferior to that of the
Eolian harp.</p>

<p class='c016'>“How extremely beautiful!” said Miss Villers.</p>

<p class='c016'>“And how admirably does it illustrate the theory of musical sounds,”
observed Mr. Seymour. “We have here, you perceive, a series of
impulses communicated to our ears by the air, at first in slow
succession, and by degrees more and more rapidly; at first we hear a
rattling noise, then a low murmur, and then a hum, which by degrees
acquires the character of a musical note, rising higher and higher in
acuteness. It is evident, therefore, from this experiment alone, by
showing the correspondence which exists between the pitch of the note
and the rapidity of the succession of the vibrations, that our
sensation of the different pitches of musical notes originates in the
different rapidities with which their impulses are communicated to our
ears.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Pray explain to us the manner in which the block of metal is thus
made to vibrate,” said Miss Villers.</p>

<p class='c016'>“It depends,” replied Mr. Seymour, “upon the alternate contraction of
the two opposite edges of the
<span class='pageno' title='303' id='Page_303'></span>metal from the loss of heat; one of the edges coming in contact with the
cold lead contracts, and by destroying the balance of the block,
causes its opposite edge to come into contact with the lead, and to
undergo the same change; and it is by this alternate action that a
rapid vibration is produced, occasioning, as you will now readily
understand, the musical sounds you have just heard.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The lecture having been concluded, Mrs. Seymour proposed that the
party should, at once, proceed to the valley, but the vicar suggested
the propriety of first explaining to the children the principle upon
which the echo depended.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour concurred in this opinion, and immediately afforded the
following explanation:--“An echo is nothing more than a reflected
sound. When the aërial vibrations strike against any obstacle of
sufficient magnitude, they are reflected back to the ear, and produce
a repetition of the sound, which will appear to proceed from the point
whence they are reflected, so that the apparent direction of the voice
becomes completely changed by an echo. A considerable extent of level
wall will sometimes produce it in great perfection; for a smooth
surface reflects sounds much better than a rough one: but the
circumstance which, perhaps, contributes more than any other to the
perfection of an echo, is the form of the reflecting surface; a convex
surface is a very bad reflector of sound, a flat one reflects very
well, but a small degree of concavity is the form best adapted to the
purpose.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I believe,” observed the vicar, “that fluid bodies will also, under
certain circumstances, so reflect sound as to produce echoes.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Undoubtedly. The surface of water, especially at the bottom of a
well; and sometimes even clouds will produce this effect.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Do you mean to say, papa,” asked Tom, “that
<span class='pageno' title='304' id='Page_304'></span>sound is reflected from an obstacle to the ear, in the same manner as
my ball is reflected after striking the wall?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Certainly: supposing, of course, that your ball is perfectly elastic;
and in that case, you no doubt remember the direction it will follow.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It will always make the angle of <i>reflection</i> equal to the angle of
<i>incidence</i>,”<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c017'><sup>[58]</sup></a> said Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Undoubtedly; and so it is with sound, since air, as you know, is
perfectly elastic. If, therefore, the vibrations fall perpendicularly
on the obstacle, they are reflected back in the same line; if
obliquely, the sound returns obliquely in the opposite direction, the
angle of reflection being equal to that of incidence. You will,
therefore, readily perceive,” continued Mr. Seymour, addressing his
conversation more particularly to Miss Villers, “that a person
situated at an appropriate angle may hear an echo, as it is returned
from the reflecting surface, without hearing the original sound which
produced it. M. Genefay has described, as existing near Rouen, a
curious oblique echo which is not heard by the person who emits the
sound. A person who sings hears only his own voice, while those who
listen hear only the echo.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“As a smooth and concave surface is capable of producing an echo, how
does it happen that we so rarely meet with one in a room?” asked
Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Echoes, my dear, are, in fact, produced in every room, by the
reverberation of sound from its walls; but on account of the velocity
with which it travels, they are imperceptible in small chambers,
because the sound occupies no sensible period of time in moving from
the mouth to the walls, and in returning back to the ear again,
consequently the original sound and its echo become so blended and
incorporated, as
<span class='pageno' title='305' id='Page_305'></span>to appear but one sound. As the dimensions of the apartment increase, the
defect will increase with it; and, in buildings for music or public
speaking, it is often highly inconvenient, and difficult of
prevention. Breaking the surface, or rendering it uneven by mouldings
and ornaments, appears to be the most effectual method of curing the
evil.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I perceive then, papa, that in order to produce a perfect echo, the
person who speaks must be at a considerable distance from the obstacle
that reflects the sound,” said Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“It cannot be otherwise,” replied her father; “and if you will only
consider the rate at which sound travels, you will readily understand
the necessity of such an arrangement. In order to produce a distinct
echo of one syllable, or of a single sound, the reflecting obstacle
must be at least 70 feet from the sound, so that it may have to pass
through a distance of 70 feet to get to the reflector, and 70 more to
return to the ear, making a total passage of 140 feet, which it will
accomplish in rather less than one-eighth of a second; a period of
time so small, that, if it were diminished, it is evident the echo
must be assimilated with the sound itself.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“But the echo in the valley,” observed Mrs. Seymour, “will repeat four
or five syllables.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Undoubtedly. If we make the experiment at a sufficient distance from
the sandstone rocks which act as the reflector.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It would appear, then, that the farther the reflecting object is off,
the greater number of syllables will the echo repeat; and I should
think that this fact might enable us to compute the distance of the
reflector,” said Mrs. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“In a moderate way of speaking, about three and a half syllables are
pronounced in one second, or seven syllables in two seconds; when an
echo,
<span class='pageno' title='306' id='Page_306'></span>therefore, repeats seven syllables, we may infer that the reflecting object is
1142 feet distant.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“But, my dear Mr. Seymour, this must surely depend upon the nature of
the syllables,” said the vicar. “Pray excuse the interruption; but you
will admit that there must exist a great difference between the echo
of dactyles and spondees. Suppose an echo should be able to return ten
syllables; thus--</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c043'>
    <div><b>‘Tityre, tu patulæ recubans--’</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c029'>I will be bound for it, that if you were to try its powers in slow
heavy spondees, as <i>monstrum horrendum</i>, a return of not more than
four or five syllables could be observed.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I will not dispute that point,” said Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>Louisa here remarked that she had often heard of some very
extraordinary echoes in different parts of the world, to which her
father had not alluded; she mentioned, for instance, those which are
said to repeat the same sound several times in succession.</p>

<p class='c016'>“From the explanation which I have already given of the nature of
echoes,” said Mr. Seymour, “it will be easily conceived that a vast
variety of effects may be produced by varying the form, the shape, the
distance, and the number of reflecting surfaces: and hence we hear of
various surprising echoes in different places. It is not difficult,
for instance, to understand the nature of compound, or tautological
echoes; in which case the expression of one <i>ha</i> will appear like a
laughter. Addison mentions an extraordinary instance of this kind near
Milan, which will return the sound of a pistol fifty-six times.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I have understood that the echoes on the lakes of Killarney are of
this multiplied description,” said the vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='307' id='Page_307'></span>“They are particularly calculated to produce reflections of sound,
from the height of the mountains, and the expanse of water,” replied
Mr. Seymour, “which latter circumstance always assists the conveyance
of reflected, as well as direct sound. I believe that there is a
certain spot on the shore of Ross island, where the sound of a bugle
produces an echo which far exceeds any other to be met with amongst
the lakes; the first echo is returned from the castle, the second from
the ruined church of Aghadoe, the third from Mangerton, and afterwards
innumerable reverberations are distinguished, which, like the faded
brilliancy of an extremely multiplied reflection, are lost by distance
and repetition.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“There is an admirable echo,” said the vicar, “behind my old college
at Cambridge; and often have I, while walking on the road to
Chesterton, on a calm evening, distinctly heard twelve repetitions of
the voice. Lord Bacon, if I remember correctly, mentions an instance
of sixteen, in some ruined church near Paris.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It was in the church of Pont-Charenton, on the Seine,” replied Mr.
Seymour; “in which place that great philosopher discovered the
inability of an echo to return the letter S, for having pronounced the
word <i>satan</i>, the echo replied <i>va-t-en</i>, which in French signifies
<i>away</i>; from which circumstance, the Parisians concluded, that some
guardian spirit prevented the walls of the sacred edifice from
pronouncing the name of <i>satan</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And will not an echo repeat the letter S?” asked Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Not always,” answered her father; “the hissing or sibilant noise of
the letter, when at the commencement of a word, is generally lost,
unless the echo be extremely perfect.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The party now set off on their excursion to the valley. Mr. Seymour
disposed them in such situations
<span class='pageno' title='308' id='Page_308'></span>as were best calculated to display the powers of the echo, and to
illustrate the several effects which he had endeavoured to explain.
The vicar performed his experiment with dactyles and spondees, and was
highly gratified to find that their results proved, in a most
satisfactory manner, the correctness of his conjecture. The attention
of Miss Villers was particularly directed to the effect of the voice
of Mrs. Seymour from the orchard gate, and which, she said, convinced
her that the sound she had heard on the preceding evening must have
arisen from the cause assigned to it.</p>

<p class='c016'>After the party had fairly tired themselves by their converse with the
airy and unsubstantial being, they descended to the sandstone rocks,
which Mr. Seymour pointed out as the local habitation of the solitary
spirit. These were duly examined by Louisa and Tom, and their
operation as a reflecting screen was pointed out to them by their
father. They now returned into the geological temple; its singularly
beautiful pillars very naturally attracted the attention of Miss
Villers, and she expressed a wish that Mr. Seymour should describe the
plan of their construction; for it was very evident, as she said, from
the disposition of the specimens, that the arrangements had been
directed with some view to geological illustration. Mr. Seymour felt
gratified by this request, and promised to comply with her wishes, as
soon as he had finished the investigation of those laws by which the
reflection of sound was governed.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Why, bless me!” exclaimed the vicar, “the revels of our airy
companion are ended; and I maintain, that nothing can be more
appropriate than the consideration of the objects for which Miss
Villers has expressed so much interest. In truth, the history of Echo
is classically associated with that of geology: by diving into the
recesses of the rock, we do but pursue her descent from air to earth;
for you, no doubt, remember that after she had been deprived
<span class='pageno' title='309' id='Page_309'></span>of her loquacity by Juno, she became enamoured of Narcissus, pined away, and
was transformed into stone.”<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c017'><sup>[59]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c016'>“I cannot but admire the ingenuity with which you embellish every
subject with classical decorations,” replied Mr. Seymour. “You,
however, must well know that I require no such allurement on the
present occasion. I shall be most willing to afford Miss Villers the
information she requires, as soon as I have explained to my young
pupils the principle of the whispering gallery in St. Paul’s; as well
as some recreations which are indebted for their effects to the
reflection of sound.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I ought to apologise for the interruption I have occasioned,” said
Miss Villers; “but I was not, until this moment, aware of the extent
to which you intended to carry your illustrations.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour commenced with the subject of the “whispering gallery,” at
the foot of the dome of St. Paul’s cathedral; and in order to render
intelligible the manner in which sound is concentrated, and thereby
magnified in that hollow hemisphere, he produced a diagram, of which
the annexed cut is a copy.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id029'>
<img src='images/figp326.png' alt='Diagram of sound magnification.' class='ig029' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>He explained it as follows:--</p>

<p class='c016'>“<b><span class='fss'>M</span></b> shows the situation of the mouth of the speaker, and <b><span class='fss'>E</span></b> that of the
ear of the hearer. Now, since sound radiates in all directions, a part
of it will
<span class='pageno' title='310' id='Page_310'></span>proceed directly from <b><span class='fss'>M</span></b> to <b><span class='fss'>E</span></b>, while other rays of it will proceed from
<b><span class='fss'>M</span></b> to <b><i>u</i></b>, and from <b><span class='fss'>M</span></b> to <b><i>z</i></b>, &amp;c.; but the ray that impinges upon <b><i>u</i></b>
will be reflected to <b><span class='fss'>E</span></b>, while that which first touches <b><i>z</i></b> will be
reflected to <b><i>y</i></b>, and from thence to <b><span class='fss'>E</span></b>; and so of all intermediate
rays, which are omitted in the figure, to avoid confusion. It is
evident, therefore, that the sound at <b><span class='fss'>E</span></b> will be much stronger than if
it had proceeded immediately from <b><span class='fss'>M</span></b> without the assistance of the
dome; for, in that case, the rays at <b><i>z</i></b> and <b><i>u</i></b> would have proceeded
in straight lines, and consequently could never have arrived at the
point <b><span class='fss'>E</span></b>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I have understood that a similar effect may be witnessed in the stone
recesses on Westminster-bridge,” said the vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>“That is the fact,” replied Mr. Seymour. “The recesses to which you
allude are semi-domes; and if a person whispers in the focus of one of
them, he will be distinctly heard by another stationed in the focus of
the opposite one. Two inanimate busts may be thus made to appear as if
holding a conversation, by placing them in the foci of two large
concave mirrors constructed of pasteboard, and arranged opposite to
each other; when a whisper uttered to the one will seem to proceed
from the other by the reflection of sound.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour now removed a shell from a group of corallines which
decorated a part of the temple, and desired Tom to place it to his
ear.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I hear a noise which appears to me to resemble that of the sea,”
cried Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Ay,” said the vicar, “and there is a popular belief that it is the
murmur of the sea, which the shell actually sends forth, betraying, as
it were, its marine origin.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And what produces the sound?” inquired Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='311' id='Page_311'></span>“The interior of the shell merely concentrates, and thus magnifies the
sounds around us, so as to render them audible: a goblet applied to
the ear will be found to produce the same effect,” replied her father.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I suppose it is upon the same principle that the speaking-trumpet is
made to convey sound to a distance,” remarked Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Since sound radiates in all directions, it follows that, if such
radiation be prevented by confining it in tubes, it may be carried to
a great distance with very little diminution of its effect; and hence
the use and application of those trumpets, or tin speaking-pipes,
which are now commonly used for conveying intelligence from one part
of a house to another. The trumpet used by deaf persons acts on the
same principle; but as the voice enters the trumpet at the large
instead of the small end of the instrument, it is not so much
confined, nor is the sound so much increased.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I believe,” said Mrs. Seymour; “that the experiment exhibited some
time since in London under the title of the <i>Invisible Girl</i>, and
which excited such general curiosity, was discovered to depend upon an
arrangement of this kind.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I expected that you would allude to that exhibition,” said Mr.
Seymour; “and as I was anxious to provide my young pupils with some
new amusement, as a reward for their industry, I have directed Tom
Plank to construct the necessary apparatus for exhibiting and
explaining the deception. On our return to the lodge, I have no doubt
we shall find that every arrangement for the performance has been
completed.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Miss Villers was now gratified by a view of the more interesting
specimens in the geological temple. Mr. Seymour also explained the
design of the pillars which had so greatly excited her curiosity.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='312' id='Page_312'></span>On the return of the party, Mr. Seymour found, as he had anticipated,
that the necessary apparatus for the experiment of the “Invisible
Girl!” had been duly arranged, and that Tom Plank was in attendance to
afford any assistance which might be farther required. We shall
proceed to describe all the visible mechanism, as it appeared to the
children on entering Mr. Seymour’s study, and of which we here present
the reader with a perspective sketch.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id030'>
<img src='images/figp329.png' alt='Apparatus for Invisible Girl experiment.' class='ig030' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>It consisted of a wooden frame, not very unlike a bedstead, having
four upright posts, <i>a a a a</i>, and a cross-rail at top and bottom to
strengthen them. The frame thus constructed stood upon a low table,
and from the top of each of the four pillars sprang four bent brass
wires, which converged to the point <b><i>c</i></b>. From these wires a hollow
copper ball was suspended by ribands, so as to cut off all possible
communication with the frame. The globe was supposed to contain the
invisible being, as the voice apparently proceeded from the interior
of it; and for this purpose it was equipped with the mouths of four
trumpets, placed around it in a horizontal direction, and at right
angles to each other, as shown in the annexed section,
<span class='pageno' title='313' id='Page_313'></span>in which the globe is represented in the centre; <i>d d d d</i> are the
trumpets, and <i>b b b b</i> the frame surrounding them, at the distance of
about half an inch from their mouths. Such as we have described was
the apparatus, which had been constructed under the direction of Mr.
Seymour, who informed the party that, if any of them would ask a
question of his little fairy, and direct the voice into one of the
trumpets, an answer would immediately be returned from the ball.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id031'>
<img src='images/figp330.png' alt='Top of the Invisible Girl apparatus.' class='ig031' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>“Let me interrogate her,” exclaimed Louisa, as she advanced towards
the railing. “Tell me, mysterious being, the name of the person who
now addresses you.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Miss Louisa Seymour,” answered a voice sufficiently audible to
Louisa, whose ear was near the mouth of the trumpet, and yet so
distant and feeble, that it appeared as if coming from a very
diminutive being, and thus heightened the deception. Each of the party
successively asked some question; and the surprise of the children may
be more easily imagined than described. Tom examined the ball, the
trumpets, and the framework; but he was unable to discover any clue by
which he could unravel the mystery. At length Mr. Seymour proceeded to
the explanation. He told them that the mechanism owed its effects to
the combined operation of two principles with which they were already
acquainted;
<span class='pageno' title='314' id='Page_314'></span>the concentration and conveyance of sound by means of a speaking-pipe, and
its reflection from an appropriate surface so as to change its
apparent direction, by producing an artificial echo. He then showed
them the pipe which was concealed in one of the legs of the frame, and
explained in what manner the voice of Tom Plank, who had been
stationed in an adjoining room, was conveyed to the mouth of the
trumpet, and thence reflected to the ear of the observer. By means of
the annexed section, we shall hope to render this subject as
intelligible to our readers, as did Mr. Seymour to his little pupils.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id032'>
<img src='images/figp331.png' alt='Side view of Invisible Girl apparatus, with secret pipe shown.' class='ig032' />
</div>

<p class='c016'><i>b b</i> represent two of the legs of the frame, one of which, as well as
half the rail, is made into a tube, the end of which opens immediately
opposite to the centre of the trumpet. This hole is very small, and
concealed by mouldings; the other end communicates by a tin pipe, <i>p
p</i>, which passes, in a concealed manner, along the floor of the room,
into an adjoining closet, where the confederate is concealed. It is
evident that any sound, directed into the mouth of the trumpet, will
be immediately reflected back to the orifice of the tube, and
distinctly heard by a person who places his ear to the mouth of the
funnel <b><i>m</i></b>; while the answer returned by him, travelling along the tin
funnel, <i>p p</i>, will issue from its concealed
<span class='pageno' title='315' id='Page_315'></span>orifice, and striking upon the concave surface of the trumpet, be returned to
the ear as an echo, and thus appear as if it had proceeded from the
interior of the ball.</p>

<p class='c016'>The vicar observed, “that this deception of the <i>Invisible Girl</i>,
which had formerly created so much interest, was little more than the
revival of the old and well-known mechanism of the <i>speaking bust</i>,
which consisted of a tube, from the mouth of a bust, leading to a
confederate in an adjoining room, and of another tube to the same
place, ending in the ear of the figure; by the latter of which, a
sound whispered in the ear of the bust was immediately carried to the
confederate, who instantly returned an answer by the other tube,
ending in the mouth of the figure, which therefore appeared to utter
it. The Invisible Girl,” continued the vicar, “evidently only differs
from that contrivance in this single circumstance, that an artificial
echo is produced by means of the trumpet, and thus the sound no longer
appears to proceed in its original direction.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Your remark is perfectly correct, my dear vicar,” said Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>Tom Plank, with an air of self-satisfaction, at this moment emerged
from his retreat, and enquired whether his performance had not met
with the approbation of his employer.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Gentlemen,” said Tom Plank, “as I am now fully satisfied that any
plan of propelling live and dead luggage through funnels can never
succeed, I propose to employ tubes for conveying sounds to a great
distance, so as to do away with the use of telegraphs?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Why that plan is more practicable, but less novel, than the one you
have just abandoned,” answered Mr. Seymour. “At the latter end of the
last century, a man of the name of Gautier conceived a method of
transmitting articulate sounds to an immense
<span class='pageno' title='316' id='Page_316'></span>distance. He proposed the construction of horizontal tunnels that should widen
at their extremities, by means of which the ticking of a watch might
be heard more distinctly at the distance of two hundred feet than when
placed close to the ear. I think he calculated that a succession of
such tunnels would transmit a verbal message nine hundred miles in an
hour.”<a href='#note50'>(50)</a></p>

<p class='c016'>“Only think of that!” ejaculated Tom Plank; “to make a communication
from London to Edinburgh in about twenty-five minutes!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“True, my friend; but what would you say, were I to suggest a method
of communicating information to any distance without the loss even of
a single second of time.”<a href='#note51'>(51)</a></p>

<p class='c016'>“There now,” cried the vicar, “you have supplied Tom Plank with some
fresh barm to set his brains working.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“He is an indefatigable fellow, I must allow,” said Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>After this discourse the vicar rose from his seat, and on walking
across the room, the creaking of his shoes excited the attention of
Mr. Seymour, who, with his accustomed gaiety, observed, that “the
vicar had music in his <i>sole</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Mr. Seymour!” exclaimed Mr. Twaddleton, with a look which we should
in vain endeavour to describe, “the infirmity of my shoes, <i>crepitus
crepidæ</i>, is at all events sanctioned by high antiquity; for we are
told by Philostratus, in his Epistles, that Vulcan, being jealous of
Venus, made her creaking shoes, in order that he might hear whenever
she stirred.”</p>

<p class='c016'>So ludicrous an appeal to antiquity would have overcome Heraclitus
himself, no wonder then that the whole party enjoyed a hearty laugh at
the worthy vicar’s expense.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well, Mr. Twaddleton, if, as you say, I have brought down philosophy
to account for the most
<span class='pageno' title='317' id='Page_317'></span>familiar occurrences, it is but just that I should return the compliment, by
declaring that you are equally prepared to throw a classical interest
around the humblest as well as the most dignified subject, <i>à capite
usque ad calcem</i>,” observed Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Now, Tom, as you have so lately been instructed in the different
sources of sound, do tell your good friend, the vicar, the cause of
the creaking of his shoes,” said his father.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The dryness of the leather, I suppose,” answered the young
philosopher.</p>

<p class='c016'>“A certain state of dryness is certainly a necessary condition, or
else the cohesion between the inner and outer sole would exclude the
air. Correctly speaking, the creaking depends upon the sudden
compression of the air contained between the two surfaces of leather;
just as a sound is produced by the clapping of the hands by the air
thus set in vibration. Shoes with single soles, therefore, never
creak, and by interposing a piece of oil-silk between the two soles,
you will so far ensure the contact of their surfaces as to obviate the
sound,” said Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“That is at all events a piece of practical philosophy worth knowing;
and I shall accordingly instruct my operator, Jerry Styles, upon this
point,” observed the vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>“So you see, my dear sir, I am no bad shoemaker, although I have never
yet made a shoe,” said Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“To be sure--to be sure,” exclaimed the vicar; “for as Horace has it--</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c043'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><b>----“Sapiens crepidas sibi nunquam</b></div>
      <div class='line in5'><b>Nec soleas fecit: Sutor tamen est sapiens.”</b><a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c017'><sup>[60]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“You never made a happier quotation,” exclaimed Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='318' id='Page_318'></span>“I have only one other remark to make,” continued he, “which the
consideration of this subject has very naturally suggested--that the
various strange sounds, which have from time to time alarmed the
superstitious, may be readily explained upon the simple principles we
have been discussing. I well remember a whole family having been
thrown into a state of terror, by a mysterious sound which regularly
recurred every evening; when it was at length discovered to arise from
the crawling of snails over the window; their slimy surfaces, as they
moved along, produced a friction, which occasioned a vibration of the
glass.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And I never recall to my recollection, without some degree of
terror,” said the vicar, “the night I passed in an old oaken chamber
which had the reputation of being haunted. A bright fire cheerfully
blazed in the grate as I entered the apartment, and casting its ruddy
light around, in some measure dissipated the prejudice which had been
raised to the disparagement of my dormitory; but awaking in the night,
my fire was out, and a succession of the most extraordinary noises I
ever heard assailed me.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“All which are easily explicable,” said Mr. Seymour. “The old oaken
materials were expanded by the heat of your fire, and on the apartment
cooling, they again contracted, and gave origin to all the sounds you
describe.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“How unsparingly does science clip the wings of imagination!” observed
Miss Villers.</p>

<p class='c016'>The party now dispersed. Miss Villers retired into the drawing-room,
to afford Louisa some musical instruction; the vicar took his
departure for the sake of visiting a sick parishioner; and Major
Snapwell to make arrangements for an important event, with the nature
of which the reader will very shortly be made acquainted.</p>

<p class='c030'><span class='pageno' title='319' id='Page_319'></span><i>An interesting communication, from which the reader may learn

<p class='c024'>For some time had Major Snapwell been occupied in making arrangements
for an event, which he hailed not only as the accomplishment of his
most ardent wishes, but as the guarantee of his future happiness. We
did not think it right to impart this secret to our readers, until the
period should arrive when, in conformity with the usage of the world,
the subject might be referred to without reserve or impropriety. To
such a period has our history arrived, and we shall therefore at once
communicate the whole story, by relating the substance of a
conversation which took place between Major Snapwell and the Vicar, in
the presence of Mr. and Mrs. Seymour, in the library of Overton Lodge.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Your hand, my dearest friend! your hand, and with it the
congratulations of your heart,” exclaimed the Major, as he approached
Mr. Twaddleton; “our friends here,” added he, as he bowed to Mr. and
Mrs. Seymour, “are already acquainted with the proposed union between
my worthy nephew, Henry Beecham, and the charming Isabella Villers;
and
<span class='pageno' title='320' id='Page_320'></span>may Heaven shed the dew of its blessing upon them!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Amen!” ejaculated the vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well, sir, I am most anxious that the ceremony should take place at
Overton, and that you should officiate upon the occasion.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Most cheerfully shall I comply with your request; ‘<i>connubio jungam
stabili</i>,’ as the immortal poet has it,” was the vicar’s reply.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I have also to inform you,” continued the major, “that it is my wish
to diffuse a portion of that delight, which this event will impart to
me, over the neighbourhood in which I shall probably pass the days
that may be yet spared to me; listen, therefore, to the plan which I
have devised for carrying this into effect. I design to give a public
entertainment, upon a plan as novel as its scale shall be extensive;
it shall not be a mere blaze of the spirits, but the recreation of the
mind, and the jubilee of reason.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“An entertainment!” muttered the vicar, whose countenance afforded any
thing but encouragement to such a scheme.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Ay, vicar; an entertainment which shall be conducted with every
regard to ancient usage, and classical correctness,” said the major,
as he cast a sly glance at Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>The countenance of the vicar brightened; and he begged his worthy
friend to be more explicit, and to state the nature of his intended
fête.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You already know that this boy of mine is shortly to conduct Miss
Villers to the temple of Hymen; I would seize that happy occasion for
giving a rural fête, in my park, to the inhabitants of Overton and its
neighbourhood; and, as there are no less than three events which I am
anxious to celebrate, I propose that this same fête shall be continued
through three successive days. On the first shall be commemorated the
providential escape of my nephew
<span class='pageno' title='321' id='Page_321'></span>from shipwreck; on the second, his marriage; and on the third, my purchase
and occupation of Osterley Park--What think you of my plan?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Why, truly, it would admit of much appropriate pageantry, and the
arrangement is, doubtless, countenanced by classical authority.
Augustus triumphed three days, for the purpose of commemorating three
great events; the first of which was the defeat of the Pannonians and
Dalmatii; the second, the battle of Actium; and the third, the
reduction of Egypt. Then, again, we have the <i>Ludi Magni</i> of the
Romans, and the solemn Athenian feast, <i>Apaturia</i>, which lasted during
three days; and above all, the Secular Games, which were continued
through the same period. In the face of such authorities, it would
certainly ill become me to offer any objection; although, as vicar of
the parish, I cannot conscientiously close my eyes against the evils
which might possibly arise from such protracted revelry. I would,
therefore, with submission, propose that the three events to which you
allude, should be celebrated by three distinct festivals on one and
the same day.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The major saw plainly that the vicar might be made to approve of, or
dissent from, any plan, by the dexterous use of classical authority;
he therefore determined to use it as a talisman for the accomplishment
of his purpose.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I like your proposition,” replied the major, “but I greatly fear that
you will not be able to support it by any classical authority; and
remember, that every thing must be conducted in the strictest
accordance with ancient usage.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I respect your intention,” answered the vicar, “and will immediately
search the writings of Lipsius for a precedent; an author who has
collected fifteen laws of the Roman entertainments; or, perhaps, the
Pandects of Franciscus Modius, who has so ably treated of nuptial
ceremonies, will furnish the desired information.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='322' id='Page_322'></span>Mr. Seymour here interrupted the conversation, by enquiring of the
major the plan of those amusements which he proposed to provide.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I will convert the elm meadow at Osterley Park into a fair,” replied
the major, “wherein every species of amusement shall be exhibited: I
will engage that vagabond Punch, who, like a snail, travels about the
country with his house at his back, to display his hereditary wit, and
mimic drolleries; tumblers, rope-dancers, conjurors, fire-eaters, and,
in short, the whole merry train of Comus, shall be pressed into our
service. After these exhibitions, the company may weave the mazy
dance, for platforms shall be erected for their accommodation; I will
arrange orchestras for music, and ornamented tents for refreshments.
The vicar,” observed the major, with an arch smile, “shall open the
ball with the bride.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Had I numbered a few olympiads less, major, I might not have declined
so flattering a distinction,” replied Mr. Twaddleton, evidently not
displeased with the compliment.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Find some classical authority for the measure, and let your age
sanction the propriety of my proposal,” said the major.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Your suggestion merits attention,--let me see--I have it, major.
Socrates learned to dance very late in life, and Cato, with all his
severity of manners, disdained not, at the age of sixty, to practise
it. I will, therefore, comply with your desire, and certainly lead the
bride down the first dance.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The canal,” continued the major, “shall, for the first time, float
the proud emblems of British glory on its glassy bosom; and when the
shades of evening fall, my Lilliputian ships shall engage--such
cannonading! such nautical evolutions!! Mr. Seymour.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“How charming! how very delightful!” exclaimed Louisa and Fanny: “but
pray, papa, do allow Tom to return from school to witness all these
amusements.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='323' id='Page_323'></span>“Fear not,” said the major; “I shall make that a condition; and I
trust your papa will not refuse the request.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Certainly not,” replied the father; “I shall be anxious to seize so
favourable an opportunity for explaining to my children the various
tricks they will witness, and the machinery by which the numerous
deceptions will be accomplished; thus shall I convert that which, to
the common eye, will appear as a scene of idle revelry, into a school
of philosophy, and in accordance with my favourite plan, ‘turn sport
into science.’”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Upon my word, Mr. Seymour, you are a perfect alchymist, and extract
gold from every thing you touch; you have already derived scientific
information from the most miscellaneous and trifling amusements, and
will, no doubt, upon this occasion, convert our very pies and puddings
into instruments of instruction; thus verifying the old adage, ‘that
there is reason in roasting of eggs,’” said the major.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I perceive that the major is not aware of the philosophy which
suggested that adage,” observed the vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Nor am I,” said Mr. Seymour, “and therefore pray enlighten us upon
that point.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You doubtless know that there is a little air bag at the large end of
every egg, called the <i>folliculus aeris</i>, and which, as we are told,
is designed to furnish a supply of air to the growing chick; if,
therefore, an egg be exposed to the temperature of hot embers, this
air will be suddenly expanded, the shell burst, and its contents
scattered into the ashes. To prevent such an occurrence, the careful
house-wife pricks the blunt end of the shell with a needle, so as to
allow the expanded air to escape, and thus to prevent the accident I
have just explained; from which it appears that there is reason, or
philosophy, in roasting an egg.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Capital, upon my word!” exclaimed Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='324' id='Page_324'></span>“Well, but, papa, we have interrupted the major in his delightful
description; he had not concluded the account of his proposed fête,”
said Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Pray go on,” cried Fanny: “let me see, where did you leave off? Oh, I
remember, you were interrupted in a temporary tent, which I hope you
intend to decorate with garlands.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Leave all that to the vicar, young lady; he will, no doubt, display
his classical taste in the emblematical appointments.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I shall terminate the festivities of the day by a grand display of
fire-works; the arrangements of which will necessarily fall under my
own more immediate direction. The vicar,” added the major, “will
perhaps allow me to proclaim him as master of the revels; for he is,
as we all well know, deeply versed in ancient customs, and I am
especially anxious that every department should be conducted with
classical taste.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I willingly accept the office,” said Mr. Twaddleton, with a gracious
smile, “since there is authority for my acquiescence. The Romans, in
their entertainments, usually appointed a person whom they styled
king, and held responsible upon such occasions. I accept it also, on a
different ground; that my presence may check the enthusiasm of the
people, and restrain the hilarity of the evening within the boundary
of rational decorum.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“If in the arrangement of your banquet, my assistance can prove of any
service, command me,” said Mrs. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Believe me sincere, my dear madam, when I say, that the kind manner
in which you receive my plan, and offer to promote its execution,
affords me the highest gratification; if I decline your services, it
is only from a fear of usurping the sovereignty of our master of the
ceremonies,” replied the major.</p>

<p class='c016'>“What! am I to descend into the lower regions,
<span class='pageno' title='325' id='Page_325'></span>and hold converse with your ancient Sibyl, the cook? Would you call upon
me to marshal the dishes? Am I, at once, to perform the offices of
‘<i>Dapifer</i>,’ ‘<i>Lardrenius</i>,’ ‘<i>Magister Coquorum</i>,’ and
‘<i>Prægustator</i>?’” cried the horrified vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Have I not declared that every part of my entertainment shall be
strictly classical? and ought not each dish to convey some moral
device, some allegorical design? Are we to feed with as little
discrimination as the dogs that devoured the sacred Apis?”</p>

<p class='c016'>The knowledge which the reader must have already collected of Mr.
Twaddleton’s character will have satisfied him that, in every action
of his life, he was more or less influenced by the spell of ancient
authority; but we doubt whether he may not yet have to learn the
extent to which the reverend gentleman carried this enthusiasm. We
shall, accordingly, beg to state a few instances, which will serve to
illustrate this circumstance. Be it known, then, that the very first
act which announced the preferment of the Reverend Peter Twaddleton to
the dignity of Vicar of Overton, was not, as some might suppose, an
increased rate of compensation for the tithes; nor was it a rate
levied for the repairs of his house; but the removal of the vane from
the spire of the church, which, as it consisted of a simple cross
piece of iron, seemed to the vicar’s imagination to be wriggling
about, without any consciousness of its ancient origin and dignity. He
therefore, at his own expense, replaced it by the figure of a cock,
which he caused to be duly executed after an authentic model. It will
be remembered that the crowing of the cock warned Peter; for which
reason the monks first placed the figure of that bird on their
churches, as an emblem to call the people to prayers; and, since the
image was made to revolve with the wind, it soon acquired the name of
the <i>weathercock</i>. With respect to the arrangement
<span class='pageno' title='326' id='Page_326'></span>of his table, he displayed an equal veneration for ancient forms. He
perpetuated the use of the wassail bowl, which was scrupulously
prepared with apples and ale, according to the most orthodox receipt.
His mince-pies at Christmas were fabricated with the same inflexible
adherence to ancient authority; he maintained that the introduction of
meat into their composition was a scandalous heresy; that the choicest
productions of the East ought alone to be admitted, since the custom
was originally intended to allegorise the offerings made by the wise
men who came from afar to worship, bringing <i>spices</i>, &amp;c. He was also
as critical with respect to the <i>shape</i>, as he was with regard to the
<i>composition</i> of these dainty inventions; he insisted upon the ancient
or coffin shape, which he stated to have been in imitation of the
cratch, or manger, wherein the infant Jesus had lain. His table was,
with the same antiquarian correctness, punctually supplied at Easter
with a gammon of bacon; a custom, which would, perhaps, have been more
honoured in the breach than in the observance, since it was evidently
founded on the abhorrence our forefathers thought proper to express
towards the Jews, at the season of commemorating the resurrection.<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c017'><sup>[61]</sup></a>
The idea was in direct opposition to the liberal sentiments of the
vicar, but, being an ancient custom, he never ventured to question its
propriety. In like manner, his tranquillity would have been sadly
disturbed, had Annette ever forgotten the <i>pancakes</i> on
Shrove-Tuesday; for he was decidedly of opinion that it was a dish
which had derived its origin from the heathen Fornacalia, a festival
instituted by Numa,<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c017'><sup>[62]</sup></a> in honour of the goddess Fornax; and was
intended to commemorate the making of bread before the invention of
ovens. Upon the subject of cross-buns
<span class='pageno' title='327' id='Page_327'></span>he displayed great profundity; he observed, that the word <i>bun</i> was
derived from <i>boun</i>, a species of sacred bread described by Hesychius,
and which was anciently offered to the gods; in support of which
opinion he quoted Julius Pollux and Diogenes Laertius; nor did he
relinquish the subject, until he had ably descanted upon the address
with which heathen customs had been, as it were, naturalized, and
perpetuated as Christian observances. The <i>boun</i>, he would say, lost
its idolatrous impurity by receiving the sign of the cross; in the
same manner that Druidical idols, and <i>stones erect</i>, by having
crosses cut upon them, continued to receive a justifiable reverence,
even as late as the seventh century.</p>

<p class='c016'>In short, the extent to which our excellent but eccentric vicar was
carried, on such occasions, can scarcely be credited, except by those
who are acquainted with the extravagant whimsies of a genuine
antiquary. We have never contemplated this part of his character
without congratulating the rising generation at Overton on the
circumstance of the offices of village schoolmaster and vicar of the
parish not having centered in the same individual; for we have not the
shadow of a doubt, so great was his veneration for ancient usages, but
he would have whipped up every child within his jurisdiction, on the
morning of Childermas-day, or that of the Holy Innocents, as we are
informed was the ancient custom, “in order that the memorial of
Herod’s murder of the Innocents might stick the closer.” On the other
hand, he would readily have forgiven any offence had the boy only
cited a few lines from a favourite classic; for often had he been
heard to relate with much satisfaction the well-known story of the
Athenian Captives, whose lives were preserved in Sicily, from their
being able to repeat portions of the dramas of Euripides. Whether, in
spite of the censure and remonstrance of St. Austin, he would have
ventured
<span class='pageno' title='328' id='Page_328'></span>to continue the half-holiday on a Thursday, it is difficult to say;
although the high antiquity of a custom originally established in
honour of Jupiter, would, doubtless, have produced its influence upon
the judgment of the antiquary.</p>

<p class='c016'>One more anecdote, and we trust our illustrations of the vicar’s
character will be perfect. The reader will remember, that to Dr.
Doseall, the renowned Esculapius of the village, he had given the
title of <i>Polyphemus</i>: this might appear inconsistent with his
acknowledged kindness, and we are therefore bound to state his
justification. “Was it not,” he asked, “a notorious custom in Athens
to give nicknames expressive of personal peculiarities? Do we not
learn from Aristophanes, that the poet Theognis, from the deficient
warmth of his compositions, went by the name of <i>Snow</i>? and moreover,
did not the Athenians, as a body, from their passion for news, and
their habit of swallowing open-mouthed the flying rumours of the day,
receive the soubriquet of <i>Gapers</i>, just as the London inhabitants of
the present day rejoice in that of <i>Cockneys</i>?”</p>

<p class='c016'>We have thought it right to relate these few anecdotes, in order to
vindicate the propriety of the major’s choice, and to convince the
reader that a better qualified master of the ceremonies could not
possibly have been provided. Having, therefore, paid this homage to
the judgment of the major, and to the antiquarian lore of the vicar,
we shall return to the party, whom we had rather abruptly quitted, and
continue our relation of the conversation which followed.</p>

<p class='c016'>“So, then, you have determined that the vicar shall superintend the
banquet,” said Mrs. Seymour. “There is, however, one part of the
ceremony which I shall certainly not feel disposed to resign into his
hands, the ordering and disposition of the bridal cakes; the genius of
Gunter shall be invoked to produce one of the most triumphant
specimens of his art.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='329' id='Page_329'></span>“Psha, nonsense! you surely would not countenance that ice-clad
mountain, through whose dark regions the demon of indigestion holds
undisputed sway.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Why, zounds, vicar, do you expect me to submit to such vagaries?--a
wedding without a cake!--it cannot be tolerated. I shall next hear of
an English feast without roast-beef,” vociferated the major.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You shall, doubtless, have your cake; but let it be the true Roman
bride-cake, made after the receipt which Cato has given in his work,
<i>De Re Rustica</i>, chapter 121. You must be aware, Mr. Seymour, that the
<i>mustacea</i> of the Romans, the species of cake used at weddings,
consisted of meal, aniseed, cummin, and several other aromatic
ingredients.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And do you seriously believe that any of us will swallow such a
medicated farrago?” said the major.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The unenlightened may, perhaps, refuse it; and should the children
prefer your modern combination, they might stand excused, since
classical inspiration rarely descends upon a boy, until he has
construed a Greek chorus,” observed the vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Were I to swallow a grain of it,” said Mrs. Seymour, “I verily
believe I should be ill for a week.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Mere prejudice, madam; the object of the <i>mustacea</i> was actually to
remove or prevent the indigestion which might be occasioned by eating
too copiously at the marriage entertainment; and it must, I think, be
acknowledged that the compound was better adapted for such a purpose
than the modern bride-cake, to which it gave origin.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“With respect to the <i>roast-beef</i>, to which the major has just
alluded,” continued the vicar, “I shall only observe, that it was not
until the reign of Henry VIII. that it appears to have taken its part
in the formation of our national character.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I would beg to enquire to whom the selection and arrangement of the
comic entertainments are to
<span class='pageno' title='330' id='Page_330'></span>be intrusted. Unless the major should have already found a competent
person, I think I can recommend to his notice an individual who is
eminently qualified for the duties,” said Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I am, at this moment, in quest of such a director,” said the major.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Ned Hopkins, then, who has for some time past taken up his abode at
our village alehouse, is the very person, of all others, whom you
seek. I have no doubt that for a trifling consideration he will
undertake the office; and I feel equally confident that he will
execute its duties to your satisfaction.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Ned Hopkins!” exclaimed the vicar, with some surprise.</p>

<p class='c016'>“To be sure; and who better understands the trim of those itinerant
sons of Comus? Was not his father a mountebank doctor, and a professor
of the art of legerdemain?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I value not Ned Hopkins the less on that account; the immortal Virgil
was the son of a servant, or assistant, to a wandering astrologer, or
‘Medicus Magus,’ as Juvenal has it; and the mother of Euripides was a
cabbage-woman, for which Aristophanes so unjustifiably ridicules him.
But my dislike to Ned Hopkins is founded upon his own dissipated
habits, his disgusting jokes, and Bacchanalian buffoonery.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Ay,” continued Mr. Seymour, “and his bad puns, vile quotations, and
hackneyed proverbs; and yet you must confess that, after all, he is a
very clever fellow.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Sir,” observed the vicar, “Satan does not usually select a fool as
his ambassador.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Upon my word, gentlemen, this must needs be a very amusing fellow;
and you have so far excited my curiosity, as to make me desirous of
hearing something farther of his history and habits,” said the major.</p>

<p class='c016'>“He is one of those loose spirits,” replied Mr. Seymour,
<span class='pageno' title='331' id='Page_331'></span>“who live upon expedients; and measuring their consciences by their
wants, derive a revenue from sources, of which those who jog on
quietly through the beaten paths of life have not the most remote
conception. He commenced his career under the tutelage of the first
fire-eater of the day, but having clumsily scalded his mouth, he lost
his reputation, and found it advisable to seek some other stage for
the display of his abilities. Possessed of a very considerable degree
of native humour and caustic shrewdness, he engaged himself as a
‘mercenary,’ or literary drudge, to a popular publisher of comic song
books, sanguinary murders, magical magazines, amorous valentines,
oracles of health, and plans for the liquidation of the national debt;
which occupations have, as I have been credibly informed, produced for
him during a successful season, some twenty or thirty pounds in the
lawful coin of the realm: but Ned, like many a great genius, was
better pleased with an hour of idleness than a week of study; and,
strange to say, would at any time have preferred a cup of wine to a
bucketful of the finest water from Helicon; no sooner, therefore, had
he collected a few pounds, than he descended from his high literary
station, a lofty garret; and, taking up his abode at some hedge
alehouse, would enjoy a life of happy leisure, until every particle of
that worldly substance which he had gained by inspiration from above,
was gratefully returned to the skies in the form of tobacco fumes. For
some months past,” added Mr. Seymour, “he has been a constant resident
at the Bag of Nails, where, as I am led to believe, he pays for
nothing but his tobacco; the worthy hostess having found him a very
profitable bait for customers, is too willing to barter the drippings
of the kitchen for his wit, and the leakage of the tap-room for his
songs.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I am very curious to become acquainted with this comical being,” said
the major.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Suppose we walk into the village,” said Mr. Seymour;
<span class='pageno' title='332' id='Page_332'></span>“we shall be certain of finding him smoking his pipe on a bench before
the alehouse door; where he is as regularly stationed by his
patroness, to catch customers, as the saucer of treacle is placed in
the window of a pastry-cook to attract flies.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You will excuse my accompanying you,” cried Mr. Twaddleton; “I cannot
relish his stale jokes and potted stories.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The gentlemen accordingly directed their route through Forest Lane,
and took leave of the vicar at the entrance of the church-yard. On
arriving within twenty yards of the public-house, Mr. Seymour noticed
a column of smoke which curled in wreaths about its porch. “There sits
Ned,” cried he; “I knew we should find him at his post.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Hopkins! Hopkins!” cried Mr. Seymour, “I fear you have not taken the
worthy vicar’s advice.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“An old dog cannot alter its way of barking, sir; nor is it easy to
straight in the oak the crook that grew in the sapling.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I am to presume, then, to speak courteously, that you are still, ‘a
man of leisure.’”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Ay, verily am I; as idle, sir, as a chimney in the dog-days,” replied
the wag of the tap-room.</p>

<p class='c016'>“That, by the by, is not a very happy simile of yours, when applied to
a man who is <i>smoking</i> all day long,” observed Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I admit it,” said Ned, “so here’s another for you,--as lazy as
Ludlam’s dog, that leaned his head against the wall to bark. But,
after all, Mr. Seymour, a day of leisure is to me a golden age, and I
am of my Lord Peterborough’s way of thinking, who used to say, ‘a
golden age was that in which every one might <i>pipe</i> when and where he
pleased.’”</p>

<p class='c016'>The wag, at this instant, gave such a practical illustration of his
theme, as would have suffocated the major, had not his military habits
rendered him smoke proof.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='333' id='Page_333'></span>“In short, gentlemen,” continued Ned, “a pipe is the solace of my life
and the mainspring of my spirits; knock out my pipe and you knock out
my brains. I verily believe that, if I could not obtain the ‘furies’
frankincense,’ as they have been pleased to call tobacco, I should be
like Vicar Breedon, who, according to William Lilly, cut the
bell-ropes and smoked them.” So saying, he gave another puff, and then
removing the pipe from his mouth, sang the following ditty:--</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c043'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><b>“Little tube of magic power,</b></div>
      <div class='line'><b>Charmer of an idle hour,</b></div>
      <div class='line'><b>Object of my warm desire,</b></div>
      <div class='line'><b>Lip of wax, and eye of fire;</b></div>
      <div class='line'><b>And thy snowy taper waist,</b></div>
      <div class='line'><b>With my finger gently braced.”</b></div>
      <div class='line in16'><b>&amp;c. &amp;c.</b></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“Always merry, Ned,” cried Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Lord bless you, sir, what is life but a jest? I jest to live, and I
live but to jest. And so I shall continue to do, until I am put to bed
by the shovel.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Your father was a reputed jester, was he not?” asked Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“He was, God bless his memory! and it was his constant prayer that his
son Neddy might turn out as sharp a man as his father; and if there be
any truth in the adage that ‘dogs bark as they are bred,’ I certainly
had as good a chance of success as most people. Momus rocked my
cradle; I ate fire before I was seven years old; and so anxiously did
my father superintend my education, that he never suffered me to cut a
morsel, until I had cut a joke. ‘Neddy,’ he used to say, ‘I perceive
you are like my bagpipes, never audible except your pouch is full of
wind; for after a good meal you are as mum as a mouse in a mill; so
remember, my lad, no joke no pudding.’ Thus schooled, I became,
through necessity, a wit, and earned every mouthful by a pun; in
short, after a little time, my genius illumined every
<span class='pageno' title='334' id='Page_334'></span>dish, and, like the fire of London, blazed from Pudding Lane to Pie
Corner.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And you afterwards appeared on the stage, as a candidate for popular
applause, which you were fortunate enough to obtain; how came you to
desert your calling?” said the major.</p>

<p class='c016'>“He who licks honey from thorns pays too dearly for it,” replied the
wit. “So I packed my wardrobe in a pocket handkerchief, and trudged
off to Cockneyshire.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And what was your object?” asked the major.</p>

<p class='c016'>“To carry my wit to a better market; and instead of retailing it at
country fairs, to offer it wholesale to some of the great publishers,
from whom I immediately received considerable orders. The profit which
rewarded my poetry soon convinced me, notwithstanding all that had
been said to the contrary, that there were still some gold mines in
Parnassus. I lived for the first week on liquid blacking. I well
remember it was winter, and although I contrived by my eulogies of the
jet polish, to obtain a daily meal from a neighbouring chop-house, I
was compelled to sit in my chamber at night without fire or candle,
until the publication of my song, ‘<i>Ah let my muse a flame inspire</i>,’
lighted a cheerful blaze in my grate, and enabled me to purchase a few
pounds of rush-lights. In short, gentlemen, without exhausting your
patience with a long recital of my adventures, suffice it to say, that
I have always been able to keep my pipe smoking by my <i>puffs</i>, my pot
boiling by the ebullition of my wit, and my grate blazing by the
<i>fire</i> of my genius; while paste and scissors have never failed to
secure a constant supply of <i>cabbage</i>, upon which I have thrived like
any caterpillar.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Here Hopkins returned to the porch, and took a draught as deep as ever
Bitias drank, or the Athenian Diotimus, nicknamed the <i>Funnel</i>, ever
swallowed.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='335' id='Page_335'></span>“Did I not say,” resumed the wag, “that my pipe was the nurse of wit?
I ought to have called her the <i>dry</i> nurse. It is a hard case,
gentlemen, but I am in the situation of the flying-fish, incapable of
keeping myself up, unless I occasionally moisten my wings.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“If you persist in this dreadful habit,” said Mr. Seymour, “you will
assuredly destroy the coat of your stomach!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The <i>coat</i> of my stomach!” replied Ned; “if that is all, my stomach
must even be contented to do what its master has so often done before
it--go in its <i>waistcoat</i>, with the understanding that it shall have
an additional glass to keep it warm. The stomach had better give up
its <i>coat</i> than its master his <i>habit</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“But suppose I could prove, that by giving up this system, you would
lengthen your days,” observed Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Lengthen my days.--you are quite right, Mr. Seymour; being rather low
in cash, I was compelled to forego my comfort for one whole day, and
it was the longest day I ever knew in my life; you are quite correct,
sir.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You are incorrigible, Ned. But come, what say you to a profitable
engagement?” asked Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Why, as to that, sir, I have always a ready mouth for a ripe cherry.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You must know, then, that my friend, Major Snapwell, proposes to give
a grand rural fête to the inhabitants of Overton; and, as he intends
to convert his grounds into a fair upon the occasion, he is desirous
of finding some person acquainted with comic entertainments, who would
undertake the office of manager, to contract with the necessary
performers, and superintend all the arrangements.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I am the lad for the major’s silver,” said the delighted wag; “for
without vanity, I may say that
<span class='pageno' title='336' id='Page_336'></span>few persons better understand the art of mixing up the motley ingredients
of fun and frolic; there is, besides, that in the major’s face which I
would willingly call master.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And were I to judge from your frontispiece,” said the major, “I
should say that every day in your calendar was a red-lettered one--the
painting of that red nose of yours must have cost a trifle.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Cannot tell; it is not yet finished,” retorted the wit.</p>

<p class='c016'>Major Snapwell, with the assistance of Mr. Seymour, now entered more
fully into the nature and extent of the exhibitions which he wished
Hopkins to provide; but as he was, at present, unable to fix the exact
period for the fête, he directed him to take such steps only as might
be necessary for securing the performers, and to hold himself in
readiness for active service.</p>

<p class='c030'><span class='pageno' title='337' id='Page_337'></span><i>The Thaumatrope.--A great improvement effected in its
construction.--Another toy upon the same optical principle.</i></p>

<p class='c024'>Tom’s holidays were now drawing to a close, and the children were
summoned into the library to receive their last lesson in philosophy.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You have lately witnessed an experiment,” said Mr. Seymour, “which
must have convinced you how liable the ear is to be deluded with
respect to the nature and direction of sound; I shall now show you
that the eye has also its sources of fallacy.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“If you proceed in this manner, you will make us all Cartesians,”<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c017'><sup>[63]</sup></a>
exclaimed the vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I shall illustrate my subject by means of a new toy which I have
lately invented,” said Mr. Seymour,
<span class='pageno' title='338' id='Page_338'></span>“and unless I am much mistaken, it will afford as much amusement to the
elder as to the younger members of our party, although the vicar may
perhaps regard it as a more hostile instrument than even that of the
wooden horse which filled unhappy Troy with an armed enemy. It is a
small machine,” continued Mr. Seymour, “which is well calculated to
furnish us with some capital puns.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“With puns!” exclaimed the horrified vicar, who no sooner heard this
appalling declaration, than like another Laocoon, he deprecated the
introduction of the “<i>donum exitiale</i>” within the walls of Overton
Lodge. But his hostility was soon disarmed, not by the circumvolutions
of a snake around the body of the enraged orator, but by the embraces
of little Rosa, who threw her arms around the neck of the vicar, with
such supplicating grace, that at length he exclaimed, “Well, well; if
it be the decree of the Fates, I must submit.”</p>

<p class='c016'>During this altercation, Mr. Seymour had procured the “wooden engine”
from his study.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I will first,” said he, “exhibit the toy in its original state, and
then show you the improvements which have been effected in it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Let us hear the account of its operation,” said the major, “which I
perceive is enclosed within the box.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“True,” replied Mr. Seymour; “and I think you will agree that I have
given a very plausible explanation of its effects.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Plausible,” muttered the vicar, “plausible enough, no doubt; oh the
Sinon!”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour then proceeded. “This toy is termed the <b><span class='fss'>THAUMATROPE</span></b>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Of Grecian origin!” observed the vicar. “‘<i>Timeo Danaos et dona
ferentes</i>,’ as Virgil has it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“What is the meaning of the term?” asked Louisa. The vicar explained
to her that it was compounded
<span class='pageno' title='339' id='Page_339'></span>of the Greek words,
θαυηα,
and
τρεπω;
the former of which
signified <i>wonder</i>, the latter <i>to turn</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Exactly,” replied Mr. Seymour. “‘<i>A Wonder-turner</i>,’ or a toy which
performs wonders by turning round: but let me proceed in the
explanation.” He then continued to read as follows: “This
philosophical toy is founded upon the well-known optical principle,
that an impression made on the retina of the eye lasts for a short
interval after the object which produced it has been withdrawn. During
the rapid whirling of the card, the figures on each of its sides are
presented with such quick transition, that they both appear at the
same instant, and thus occasion a very striking and magical effect. On
each of these cards a device is introduced, with an appropriate motto,
or epigram; the point of which is answered, or explained, by the
change which the figure assumes during the rapid whirling of the
card.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It may be very clever,” said the vicar, “but I do not understand it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“But you shortly will; look at one of the cards.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour then displayed a pasteboard circle, on the one side of
which was figured a rat, and on the other, a cage; two strings were
fastened in its axis, by which the card could easily be made to
revolve, by means of the thumb and finger. Fearing that some of our
readers may be as dull of comprehension as the vicar, we have
introduced a sketch of the apparatus, in which both sides of the card
are exhibited, with the strings by which it is whirled round.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id034'>
<img src='images/figp356.png' alt='Two circular cards with strings attached, one with an empty cage and one with a rat.' class='ig034' />
</div>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='340' id='Page_340'></span>No sooner had Mr. Seymour put the card in motion, than the vicar, in a
tone of the greatest surprise, exclaimed, “Magic! magic! I declare the
rat is in the cage!!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And what is the motto?” asked Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Why is this rat like an opposition member in the House of Commons,
who joins the ministry?” replied Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Ha, ha, ha!--excellent!” cried the major, as he read the following
answer: “because by <i>turning round</i> he gains a snug berth, but ceases
to be free.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The very reverse to what occurred in ancient Rome, where the slave
became free by turning round,” observed the vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>The vicar, no doubt, alluded to the custom of making a freeman, as
described by Persius; from which it appears, that the clapping a cap
on the head, and giving him a turn on the heel, were necessary
circumstances. A slave thus qualified became a citizen of Rome, and
was honoured with a name more than belonged to any of his forefathers,
which Persius has repeated with a great deal of humour in his 5th
satire:--</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c043'>

      <div class='line'><b>“----Heu steriles veri, quibus una Quiritem</b></div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='c053'><b><span class='sc'>Dryden.      </span></b></div>

<p class='c016'>“Show us another card,” said Tom, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Here then is a watch-box; when I turn it round, you will see the
watchman comfortably sleeping at his post.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Very good! It is very surprising,” said the vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Yes,” observed the major; “and to carry on your political joke, it
may be said that, like most worthies who gain a post, by <i>turning
round</i>, he sleeps over his duty.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='341' id='Page_341'></span>“The epigram which accompanies it is not deficient in point,” said Mr.
Seymour.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c043'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><b>“The caprice of this watchman surpasses all bound</b></div>
      <div class='line in1'><b>He ne’er sits in his box, but when going his <i>round</i></b></div>
      <div class='line in1'><b>While he no sooner rests, ’tis a strange paradox!</b></div>
      <div class='line in1'><b>Than he flies from his post, and <i>turns</i> out of his box.”</b></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“What have you there?” exclaimed the vicar; “arms and legs, without a
body?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Yes,” replied Mr. Seymour; “and which, on turning round, will present
the figure of a king, invested with all the insignia of royalty.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is indeed a king. Look at his crown and sceptre!” cried Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Now for the epigram,” said the major, who then read the following
lines:--</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c043'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><b>“Head, legs, and arms, alone appear;</b></div>
      <div class='line in1'><b>Observe that <i>nobody</i> is here;</b></div>
      <div class='line in1'><b>Napoleon-like I undertake</b></div>
      <div class='line in1'><b>Of nobody a king to make.”</b></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The next card presented a laughing face, which on being turned round,
was instantly changed into a weeping one. The motto--<i>The sweetest
things turn sour</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The device is capital!” exclaimed the vicar, “I question whether
Peter of Cortona ever produced a more striking metamorphosis.”<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c017'><sup>[64]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c016'>The other cards were now exhibited in succession, of which the box
contained eighteen, and the whole party, not even excepting the vicar,
were highly gratified with the amusement.</p>

<p class='c016'>“But I have not yet read to you the author’s
<span class='pageno' title='342' id='Page_342'></span>address to the public; and which, I must say, contains a succession of
very happy puns.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Spare me! spare me!” cried the vicar: “I like your toy, but cannot
discover the advantage of alloying amusement with such spurious wit,
and of associating science with buffoonery.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour, however, was relentless, and thus proceeded: “It is well
known that the Laputan philosopher invented a piece of machinery, by
which works could be composed by a mechanical operation; and the
Quarterly Review has asserted, that a certain English poem was
fabricated in Paris, by the powers of a steam-engine; but the author
of the present invention claims for himself the exclusive merit of
having first constructed a hand-mill, by which puns and epigrams may
be <i>turned</i> with as much ease as tunes are played on the hand-organ,
and old jokes so <i>rounded</i> and changed, as to assume all the airs of
originality. The inventor confidently anticipates the favour and
patronage of an enlightened and liberal public, on the well-grounded
assurance, that ‘<i>one good turn</i> deserves another;’ and he trusts that
his discovery may afford the happy means of giving activity to wit
that has been long <i>stationary</i>; of <i>revolutionising</i> the present
system of <i>standing</i> jokes, and of putting into <i>rapid circulation</i>
the most approved bon-mots.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Why, vicar, what ails thee?” exclaimed the major.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Our subject has given him a <i>turn</i>; let him alone, and he will soon
<i>come round</i>,” observed Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>The whole party, with the exception of Mr. Twaddleton, laughed
heartily; the vicar, however, did not relax a feature of his
countenance.</p>

<p class='c016'>As soon as this ebullition had subsided, the major enquired of Mr.
Seymour, what was the nature of the improvement to which he had
alluded.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='343' id='Page_343'></span>“My proposed improvements refer both to the subjects exhibited on the
cards, and to the mechanism by which their changes are effected,”
replied Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“In the first place, it has occurred to me that this amusing toy might
be made instrumental in impressing classical subjects upon the memory
of young persons.”</p>

<p class='c016'>This observation delighted the vicar, who said that he would patronise
such an attempt with all his heart.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Why can we not,” continued he, “thus represent the Metamorphoses of
Ovid; or what say you, vicar, to converting the fleet of Æneas into
sea-nymphs, as Virgil has it?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“An elegant thought! upon my word; a most elegant conception!”
exclaimed Mr. Twaddleton.</p>

<p class='c016'>“What have we here?” interrupted the major, who had, for the first
time, noticed the superscription on the cover of the box: “had I seen
this before, I should have augured favourably of the toy: it is like
the sign of an inn, which is held out to announce good entertainment
within.” He then read the following:--</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>The Thaumatrope;</div>
    <div>being</div>
    <div><i>Rounds</i> of Amusement,</div>
    <div>or</div>
    <div>How to please and surprise</div>
    <div>By <i>Turns</i>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour now proceeded to explain more fully the optical theory of
the instrument, which neither Louisa nor Tom could, as yet, thoroughly
understand.</p>

<p class='c016'>He told them that an object was seen by the eye, in consequence of its
image being delineated on the retina, or optic nerve, which is
situated on the back part of the eye; and that it had been
ascertained,
<span class='pageno' title='344' id='Page_344'></span>by experiment, that the impression which the mind thus receives, lasts
for about the eighth part of a second after the image is removed. “It
is, therefore, sufficiently evident,” said Mr. Seymour, “that if any
point, as a lighted stick, be made to revolve, so as to complete the
circle in that period, we shall not see a fiery point, but a fiery
circle; because the impression made by it in every point of its
circuit will remain until it comes round again to the spot from which
it set out;--but we will, at once, exemplify this fact by an
experiment.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Tom was accordingly directed to procure a piece of stick and a candle;
and as soon as they were brought into the room, Mr. Seymour ignited
the end of the stick and whirled it round, when a bright circle,
without any intervals of darkness, was seen by the whole party.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Never until this instant,” exclaimed the vicar, with an expression of
high satisfaction, “did I fully appreciate the beauty of that passage
in Milton, wherein the poet evidently describes the rapidity of
Satan’s flight, as well as the refulgence of his appearance--</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>“<b>‘Sprung upward like a pyramid of fire.’</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“Now to take in the full meaning of this figure,” continued Mr.
Twaddleton, “we must imagine ourselves in chaos, and that a vast
luminous body is rising near the spot where we may be supposed to be
standing, so swiftly as to appear a continued track of light, and
lessening to the view, according to the increase of distance, until it
ends in a point, and then disappears; and all this must be supposed to
strike our eye at one instant.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is very probable,” said Mr. Seymour, “that the poet had such an
idea in view, and that he intended by it to convey the immense
rapidity of Satan’s flight. Homer makes use of the same figure
<span class='pageno' title='345' id='Page_345'></span>to express the velocity of the javelin,
δολιχοσκιον εγχος,
the ‘<i>long shadowed</i>’ javelin. We shall have ample proof of the effect of
this power in the eye of retaining impressions, and of thus converting
points into lines and circles, during the exhibition of your
fire-works; and which, in fact, derive the greater part of their
magical effect from it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The pin wheel is certainly nothing more than a fiery circle produced
by the rapid revolution of a jet of flame,” said the vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>“And the rocket,” added Mr. Seymour, “is a column of light occasioned
by the same rapid movement of a burning body in a rectilinear or
curved direction.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I perfectly understand all that you have said,” observed Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Then you will not have any difficulty in explaining the action of the
Thaumatrope, for it depends upon the same optical principle; the
impression made on the retina by the image, which is delineated on one
side of the card, is not erased before that which is painted on the
opposite side is presented to the eye; and the consequence is, that
you see both sides at once.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Or, you might put it in this way,” said the major: “that as the image
remains the eighth of a second on the retina, after it has been
withdrawn from the eye, a revolution of eight times in a second will
secure its uninterrupted continuance.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“On turning round the card,” observed Louisa, “I perceive that every
part of the figure is not equally distinct.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Because every part of the card does not revolve with the same
velocity,” said her father; “and this fact offers a good illustration
of what I formerly stated,<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c017'><sup>[65]</sup></a> that in circular motion, the parts more
remote from the axis of rotation are those which move
<span class='pageno' title='346' id='Page_346'></span>with the greater velocity. This toy will also be found capable of
exemplifying another truth to which I have before alluded, that ‘the
axis of motion remains at rest while all the parts revolve round
it.’”<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c017'><sup>[66]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c016'>“I remember that very well,” exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Then take the card, and spin it between yourself and the window, and
tell me what you observe,” said his father.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I see a dark line across the window; and what is very strange, the
other parts of the card appear transparent; for they do not obstruct
the view of the window, as they would if the card were at rest.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The dark line you see is the axis of rotation, which being
stationary, necessarily excludes the light; the other parts being in
motion do not remain a sufficient time to obliterate the image made on
the eye by the window. It is true that the card disc passes between
your eye and the light, but as it does not continue at any one point
for more than the eighth of a second, there is no more apparent
intermission of the light than what occurs during the winking of the
eyes.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You allude to a very curious fact,” observed the vicar, “that,
although we are perpetually covering the eyeballs with our eyelids, we
are not conscious of the intervals of darkness.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The reason of which must surely be obvious from the explanation I
have just offered,” said Mr. Seymour: “the sensation of light is not
exchanged for that of darkness in so short a period as the twinkling
of the eye.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I admit the plausibility of your theory,” said the vicar; “but it
appears to me that objects frequently linger on the sight for a longer
period than that which you assign to them. I well remember seeing the
flame of a candle for several seconds after it had been suddenly
withdrawn from the apartment.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='347' id='Page_347'></span>“I admit that strong lights frequently continue for some time thus
visible in the ‘mind’s eye;’ and it is well known that such
impressions are often followed by images of similar shape, but of
various colours. In passing from sunshine to a dark room, we
frequently witness the appearance of stars and circles of
vari-coloured light; but this phenomenon is very distinct from that of
the Thaumatrope, and is to be explained upon very different
principles.”<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c017'><sup>[67]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c016'>“I know exactly to what you allude,” said the major: “and I do not
doubt but that many of those illusive appearances, which have been
described, might be referred to the operation of the same natural
cause. It is easy to imagine that a person who has steadfastly fixed
his eyes upon an illuminated object, may, for some minutes afterwards,
see the same figure in shade; it was from such a cause, no doubt, that
Constantine saw the image of a cross in the sky. You are, probably,
acquainted with the opinions of Eusebius, Fabricius, and Dr. Lardner,
upon this alleged miracle.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Yes,” exclaimed the vicar, “and I also know, that this miracle for
the conversion of Constantine gave origin to the Catholic custom of
illuminating the cross at St. Peter’s in Rome.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Sir David Brewster, in his late work on Natural Magic, has given us a
beautiful illustration of the same principle; it is as follows,” said
Mr. Seymour. “A figure dressed in <i>black</i> and mounted upon a <i>white</i>
horse, was riding along exposed to the bright rays of the sun, which
through a small opening in the clouds was throwing its light only upon
that part of the landscape. The <i>black</i> figure was projected against a
white cloud, and the white horse shone with
<span class='pageno' title='348' id='Page_348'></span>particular brilliancy by its contrast with the dark soil against which it was
seen. A person interested in the arrival of such a stranger, had been
for some time following his movements with intense anxiety; but upon
his disappearance behind a wood, was surprised to observe the spectre
of the mounted stranger in the form of a <i>white</i> rider upon a <i>black</i>
steed, and this spectre was seen for some time in the sky, or upon any
pale ground to which the eye was directed.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I cannot understand why the spectre should be opposite in colour to
the real image,” observed Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is a law of vision which you must for the present take for
granted,” answered his father; “that such is the fact, however,”
continued he, “I will satisfy you by a very simple experiment.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour here placed three different coloured wafers in a
triangular form on a piece of white paper, and instructed his son to
fix his eyes steadily upon them for a minute; this having been
performed, he next directed him to turn them from the wafers to a
blank part of the paper, and to tell him what he saw.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I see,” exclaimed Tom, “three spectral wafers, but the colours are
different; the red wafer is represented by a <i>green</i>, the violet by a
<i>yellow</i>, and the orange by a <i>blue</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You now then understand what is meant by the spectral or accidental
colour of a body:--But let us return to the subject of the
Thaumatrope,” said Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Behold!” continued he, “the Trojan ships!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Ay, ay, sure enough,” said the vicar; “but let me see, are their
forms according to ancient authority? Very well indeed, Mr. Seymour.
Very well; the poops have the bend so accurately described by Ovid and
Virgil--‘<i>puppesque recurvæ</i>,’ as the poet has it. And there is the
triton; but is its size in proportion to the vessel? Yes, sir, you are
doubtless
<span class='pageno' title='349' id='Page_349'></span>correct, the figure is generally represented of considerable magnitude on
ancient medals; and Silius Italicus, if my memory serves me, alludes
to the weight of the image having on some occasions contributed to the
wreck of the vessel.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Spin them round,” said Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>The vicar complied; exclaiming at the same moment, “‘<i>Vos ite solutæ.
Ite deæ pelagi.</i>’ They are positively converted into sea-nymphs.
‘<i>Mirabile monstrum!</i>’” cried Mr. Twaddleton.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Here is another classical device; the representation of Eurydice, as
she fell lifeless at the moment Orpheus turned round to gaze on her,”
said Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Charming! charming! I perceive that it is a copy from the splendid
print of Didot in the Paris edition of Virgil.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Turn it round, vicar.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“See! see! she revives, she opens her eyes, and throws her arms around
the neck of her frantic lover: truly, Mr. Seymour, this is a most
interesting toy,” said Mr. Twaddleton.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour here observed that he had written an epigram to accompany
the subject they had just witnessed, and he trusted that he had given
to it a classical <i>turn</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>“By all means read it; the subject admits of much classical
decoration,” observed the vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>Louisa received the epigram from the hands of her father, and read as
follows:--</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c043'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><b>“By <i>turning round</i>, ’tis said, that Orpheus lost his wife;</b></div>
      <div class='line'><b>Let him <i>turn round</i> again, and she’ll <i>return</i> to life.”</b></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>It could not be expected that Mr. Twaddleton should have admired lines
so burdened with puns; but he quietly observed, “I should have
preferred a quotation from the fourth Georgic, so beautifully
descriptive of the fable.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='350' id='Page_350'></span>The next card that was presented for inspection exhibited the
metamorphosis of Daphne into a laurel. As the figure revolved, the
leaves were seen sprouting from her fingers, and her arms lengthening
into branches.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Come now,” said Mr. Seymour, “let us exhibit the figure which has
been designed at my request: the change which it will undergo during
its revolution may, I trust, on some day be realised; I only regret
that it is not in my power to give the vicar so good a <i>turn</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Really, if like Crambe, in Martinus Scriblerus, thou hadst a word for
every day in the year, I should certainly say that you were this day
under the dominion of the word <i>turn</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You know this resemblance?” said Mr. Seymour, as he showed the
figure, painted on one side of the card, to his daughter.</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is the vicar!” exclaimed Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>It was, indeed, a portrait of that most excellent character,
represented in the costume in which he usually appeared.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Turn it round,” said Mrs. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>Louisa twirled the cord, and the effect of the rotation was to convert
the humble vicar into the dignified bishop; his meagre form was
instantly changed into a corpulent figure, which was still farther
inflated by the addition of the episcopal robe and lawn sleeves, while
his angular features were softened by the graceful curves of an
immense wig.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I will give you a motto for it,” said the major, “and may it be
prophetic!--<b><span class='fss'>RAPID PREFERMENT</span></b>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I will now show you the improvement which has been effected in the
construction and use of this toy,” said Mr. Seymour. “It consists in
altering the axis of rotation while the card is in the act of
revolving, in order that the images on its opposite sides may be
brought in different positions with respect to each other.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='351' id='Page_351'></span>“There cannot be any doubt that such would be the effect, were it
possible to change the axis in the way you propose, but how is this to
be effected?” asked the vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>“At first I attempted to produce the change by the addition of several
other strings, but I soon found, that, in order to avail myself of
this expedient, I should be obliged to stop the card before I could
alter the axis, whereas my great object, as I have just stated, was to
produce the change while the card was in the act of spinning,”
answered Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“And I shrewdly suspect that such must necessarily be the case, adopt
whatever expedient you may,” observed the major.</p>

<p class='c016'>“No indeed; I have at length succeeded to my entire satisfaction, and
that too by a most simple scheme, after having tried without success
many very complicated contrivances.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The party were very desirous of witnessing this triumph of skill, and
Mr. Seymour produced the card, with its appendages, of which we shall
here present our readers with an engraving:--</p>
<div  class='figcenter id035'>
<img src='images/figxviii01.png' alt='Fig. 1. Circular card with bottle and another with man’s torso.' class='ig035' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>In all respects the card is constructed like the common Thaumatrope;
the subject, it will be perceived, is that of a man drinking, the
bottle being placed on one side, and the head on the other; upon
revolving the card, in the ordinary manner,
<span class='pageno' title='352' id='Page_352'></span>the two images will appear together as represented in:</p>
<div  class='figcenter id036'>
<img src='images/figxviii02.png' alt='Fig. 2. Man with bottle halfway to his mouth.' class='ig036' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>The improvement consists in inserting in one, or, if a still greater
change be desired, in both sides of the card, two strings, as seen in
Fig. 1; viz. <b><span class='fss'>A D</span></b> and <b><span class='fss'>A E</span></b>, which united at <b><span class='fss'>A</span></b>, form a common string for
twirling the card. The cord <b><span class='fss'>A D</span></b> is elastic, while the string <b><span class='fss'>A E</span></b> is
incapable of being stretched. If, therefore, while the card is in the
act of spinning, the cord <b><span class='fss'>A D</span></b> be pulled with an increased force, it
will take the position <b><span class='fss'>D C</span></b>, while the inelastic string <b><span class='fss'>A E</span></b> will at the
same time assume that of <b><span class='fss'>E C</span></b>. The consequence of which will be that,
instead of the card spinning on an axis in the direction <b><span class='fss'>A B</span></b>, it will
now spin on that which is in the direction <b><span class='fss'>C B</span></b>, and we shall
accordingly see the images on the opposite sides of the card in
different positions, with respect to each other; at one moment the
bottle will be seen in the hand of the drinker as represented in Fig. 2,
and in the next, at his mouth as shown in the cut below:</p>
<div  class='figcenter id037'>
<img src='images/figxviii03.png' alt='Fig. 3. Man with bottle at his mouth.' class='ig037' />
</div>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' title='353' id='Page_353'></span>while, by alternately tightening and relaxing the string, the figure
will be seen in the very act of raising and lowering the bottle.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour having explained the principle of his improvement as we
have above related, proceeded to exemplify it by a series of different
subjects. We shall select two or three of them for the sake of
illustration. A card with a jockey on one side and a horse on the
other, on spinning round presented the combined figure; upon
tightening the string, in the manner we have described, the card
changed its axis, without the slightest halt or hesitation in its
rotation, and the rider was in an instant canted over the head of his
charger; in a moment, however, he appeared remounted; after which, by
pulling the string, with different degrees of force, he was made to
stand on the saddle, and to exhibit a number of different movements.</p>

<p class='c016'>The figure of an Indian juggler was represented in the act of throwing
up <i>two</i> balls; on spinning the card, and, at the same time, altering
the position of the circle, in the manner already described, <i>three</i>,
and afterwards <i>four</i>, became visible. When the card revolved upon its
original axis, two of the balls on the reverse side coincided with the
two painted on the front, so that during the revolution they fell upon
the same spot on the retina, and therefore produced a single
impression; but as soon as the position of the card was changed, these
spots were brought upon different points, and consequently produced
separate and independent images. By alternately tightening and
relaxing the strings, the balls were seen in motion, arising from and
falling into the hand of the juggler.</p>

<p class='c016'>The next subject which we shall describe produced a considerable
degree of merriment. The vicar inspected the drawing, and observed
that he saw a pulpit placed on the banks of a pond; the card was
<span class='pageno' title='354' id='Page_354'></span>made to spin, when a tailor was seen haranguing from the former, and a
goose, at the same instant, fluttering over the water. The circle was
now suddenly shifted, and the vicar was desired to state what he
saw:--“Why, bless me!” exclaimed Mr. Twaddleton, “the tailor is justly
served, he is ducked in the pond, while the goose has taken his place
in the pulpit.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Fearing that we may have exhausted the patience of our reader, we
shall only relate one more example. It was a Turk, who, by means of
the expedient we are illustrating, was made to draw his sabre, and cut
off the head of his antagonist, which immediately fell into the hands
of the decapitated person, who, like St. Denys, appeared as if walking
off with perfect indifference.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You must admit that these effects are no less novel than they are
extraordinary, and that they are capable of almost endless variation,”
said Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I admit it all,” replied Mr. Twaddleton, “and I have only to express
a hope that, amidst all your improvements, you will never lose sight
of your first and most laudable design, that of rendering your toy
subservient to classical illustration: your triumph will then be
complete, and I shall willingly acknowledge that there is not only
philosophy but literature in your sport.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I must not quit this subject,” said Mr. Seymour, “until I have
exhibited another toy, which, like the Thaumatrope, is indebted for
its effect to the optical principle, which I trust is now well
understood by all present, viz. that <i>an impression made on the retina
lasts for a certain period after the object itself has been
withdrawn</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The annexed wood-cut represents the instrument to which Mr. Seymour
alluded.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id038'>
<span class='pageno' title='355' id='Page_355'></span>
<img src='images/figp372.png' alt='A blackened tin plate with slit, mounted on stand, in view A; the image of a star as seen, in view B.' class='ig038' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>It consists of a disc of blackened tin plate, which is made to revolve
on its axis in the manner above exhibited. A narrow opening extends
from the circumference to the centre as seen at <b><span class='fss'>A</span></b>. If a device of any
kind, as a star (which for increasing the beauty of the experiment
ought to be transparent, and illuminated with a lamp) be placed behind
the disc, it is evident that, as long as the circle remains at rest,
no other part of the figure can be visible than that which is
immediately behind the slit <b><span class='fss'>A</span></b>, but the instant it is put into rapid
motion, the whole of the star will be seen, as exhibited in figure <b><span class='fss'>B</span></b>.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour observed that the explanation of the phenomenon was
obvious;--each successive portion of the figure seen through the
opening remains on the eye, until the circle has completed its entire
revolution.</p>

<p class='c016'>“This experiment,” continued Mr. Seymour, “admits of a very curious
modification, which I shall now proceed to exhibit.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Three coloured wafers were then placed, at equal distances from each
other, on the disc, and the instrument
<span class='pageno' title='356' id='Page_356'></span>having been arranged before a looking-glass, the party were desired to
observe the reflected image as the circle revolved.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The wafers are blended into one continuous zone,” observed Mrs.
Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“To be sure,” said Louisa; “upon the same principle that the ignited
stick appears as a fiery circle.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It would be very strange, after the different experiments we have
seen, if we were not able to explain the present appearance,” observed
Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The fiery circle produced by the revolving stick is a much better
illustration of the principle; I do not see what object Mr. Seymour
has in thus multiplying his experiments,” said the vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Gently, if you please, Mr. Twaddleton, and, before you favour us with
your criticism, wait until I have concluded my experiment. You have
seen that the reflected image of the revolving wafers appears as a
continuous zone, and you have very correctly explained the reason of
such an appearance; but I must now request you to inspect the
reflected image through the slit in the disc, as it revolves, and say
what new effect you observe.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“How very strange!” exclaimed Tom; “I see the three wafers very
distinctly, and perfectly at rest.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Impossible,” exclaimed the vicar--“let me have a peep. Why, I
declare, they appear, as you say, stationary, although I know them to
be in rapid motion; as sure as fate I shall become a Cartesian.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The Major, Louisa, and Mrs. Seymour, were all equally surprised, and
incapable of giving any explanation of the phenomenon they had
witnessed.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Let us remember,” said Mr. Seymour, “that in viewing the image
through the slit in the revolving disc, we catch but a momentary
glance as it passes before the eye, and that the image thus produced
on the retina is retained until the next revolution again
<span class='pageno' title='357' id='Page_357'></span>brings the slit into the same position. Now it is evident, that before the
eye can ascertain a body to be in motion, it must observe it in two
successive portions of time, in order to compare its change of
place;<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c017'><sup>[68]</sup></a> but in the experiment under consideration, the glance is
momentary, the wafer is no sooner seen than it passes away; its figure
alone is impressed upon the retina, and this impression is continued
without any change, until the circle completes its round, and
consequently the image must appear at rest.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I understand you; the figure, but not the motion, of the wafer, is
discernible in the short period during which it is visible through the
slit,” observed the vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I lately witnessed a beautiful illustration of this subject at the
Royal Institution,” said Mr. Seymour. “A number of cogged wheels, cut
out of pasteboard, were set in motion in a perfectly dark room, when
occasional flashes of light from an electric battery, displayed their
forms most distinctly, and yet although whirling round at the time,
they appeared to the spectator as motionless as so many solid blocks
of marble. In like manner, in a storm during the darkness of midnight,
the rolling ship and waves, when rendered visible by flashes of
lightning, will appear as completely at rest, as a representation of
them upon the canvass.[68a] I may at some future time extend this
interesting subject, by exhibiting some optical illusions produced by
the revolution of wheels in different directions, and at different
velocities, for the knowledge<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c017'><sup>[69]</sup></a> of which we are indebted to Mr.
Faraday, and in mentioning that distinguished philosopher,” added Mr.
Seymour, addressing himself more particularly
<span class='pageno' title='358' id='Page_358'></span>to the vicar, “I cannot avoid remarking, that if <i>Philosophy in Sport</i>
can be made <i>Science in Earnest</i>, the juvenile lectures delivered by
that professor have established the converse proposition, that the
sternness of Science may be relaxed into the engaging aspect of
Sport.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Before quitting this subject,” continued he, “I have yet another toy
in store for your amusement; it is founded upon the optical principle
which I have every reason to believe you now thoroughly understand.” A
square box was then produced containing a number of card discs, the
edges of which exhibited a series of notches corresponding with the
figures delineated on their margins. That the reader may better
understand their construction, as well as the explanation of Mr.
Seymour, the following representation has been introduced.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id039'>
<img src='images/figp375.png' alt='As explained above. Figure is a dark-skinned man jumping in the air.' class='ig039' />
</div>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='359' id='Page_359'></span>“To exhibit the magical effects of this toy,” said Mr. Seymour, “I will,
by means of the spindle to which it is attached, cause it to revolve
rapidly before the looking-glass, and you shall view the reflection
through the openings.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Each member of the party obeyed in succession the direction thus
given, and severally expressed the great astonishment they felt, at
observing the figures in constant motion, and exhibiting the most
grotesque attitudes.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Now,” said Mr. Seymour, “attend to my explanation. Each figure is
seen through the aperture, and as it passes and is succeeded in rapid
succession by another and another, differing from the former only in
attitude, the eye is cheated into the belief of its being the same
object successively changing the position of its body. Consider what
takes place in an image on the retina when we actually witness a man
in motion; for instance, a man jumping over a gate, in the first
moment he appears on the ground, in the next his legs are a few inches
above it, in the third they are nearly on a level with the rail, in
the fourth he is above it, and then in the successive moments he is
seen descending as he had previously risen. A precisely similar effect
is produced on the retina, by the successive substitution of figures
in corresponding attitudes, as seen through the orifices of the
revolving disc; each figure remaining on the retina long enough to
allow its successor to take its place without an interval that would
destroy the illusion.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Nothing can be more satisfactory than your explanation of this very
extraordinary toy,” observed the vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I am now about to exhibit what I consider a great improvement in its
construction, inasmuch as we thus get rid of the mirror, and enable
two persons to witness the deception at the same time,” said Mr.
<span class='pageno' title='360' id='Page_360'></span>Seymour. “For this purpose I have a spindle, at each end of which a disc is
placed, and which I hold in my hand.” We deem it expedient to

<p class='c016'>“By revolving the spindle, you perceive that both cards are made to
turn round with equal velocity. Tom,” said his father, “look through
the orifices of the disc, on my right hand, and Louisa, do the same on
my left.” The children obeyed, and simultaneously expressed their
wonder at what they witnessed. “The figures are all dancing!” cried
Tom; “The horses are all prancing!” exclaimed Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You have not yet told us the name of this toy,” observed the vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>“It has received several names,” answered Mr. Seymour, “as
<i>Phantasmascope</i>, <i>Phenakistiscope</i>, &amp;c. derived, as you no doubt
perceive, from the Greek.”</p>

<p class='c016'>It is scarcely necessary to observe, that the appearances thus
produced may be infinitely varied--heads opening their mouths, and
distorting their countenances; creeping serpents, and machinery in
active
<span class='pageno' title='361' id='Page_361'></span>operation, are amongst the subjects that have excited the greatest admiration.</p>

<p class='c016'>The party now dispersed, not less gratified than they had been
instructed by the lesson of the morning.</p>

<hr class='c054' />

<p class='c016'>The mighty magician of the North has compared the course of a
narrative to the progress of a stone rolled down hill by an idle
truant boy, “which at first moveth slowly, avoiding by inflection
every obstacle of the least importance; but when it has attained its
full impulse, and draws near the conclusion of its career, it smokes
and thunders down, making a rood at every spring, clearing hedge and
ditch like a Yorkshire huntsman, and becoming most furiously rapid in
its course when it is nearest to being consigned to rest for ever:
even such,” says he, “is the course of a narrative; the earlier events
are studiously dwelt upon; but when the story draws near its close, we
hurry over the circumstances, however important, which your
imagination must have forestalled, and leave you to suppose those
things which it would be abusing your patience to relate at length.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Let the reader of the present work accept this explanation, as an
apology for the abrupt and rapid manner in which we shall now
accelerate our narrative. Since the last lecture, our history has
advanced nearly three weeks, during which interval the major had made
every arrangement for the approaching marriage. It was finally agreed
that the ceremony should be performed at Overton church; and as the
“happy couple” expressed a wish to pass their “honey moon” in a
retired part of Yorkshire, the major consented to postpone his fête
until after their return; nor was he displeased at such an
arrangement, as it afforded time for getting up his entertainment
<span class='pageno' title='362' id='Page_362'></span>on a more liberal scale than could otherwise have been accomplished. We
shall now avail ourselves of that peculiar Lethean property which has
been often ascribed to the pen of the author, and commit the reader to
the arms of Morpheus, where it is our intention that he shall remain
until the morning of the nuptials.</p>

<p class='c016'>Reader, awake! the sun has risen, and Nature is robing herself in her
most gorgeous apparel for the approaching ceremony; the family of the
lodge have been already roused from their slumbers by the attendance
of minstrels, whom the vicar had directed to salute the bridal party
at break of day.----But hark! while we are thus trifling, the village
of Overton is in a bustle; the marriage ceremony is over; the bells of
the church are ringing right merrily their festive peals; many a
handkerchief is waving from the cottage windows, while the doors are
decorated with garlands; the vicarage is ornamented with fragments of
Venetian tapestry; the peasants, dressed in their holiday garments,
are carrying nosegays in their hands, to present to the bride as an
offering of their respect, or to strew in her path, as an emblematic
expression of their wishes.</p>

<p class='c016'>The party having reached Osterley Park, we were proceeding to describe
the banquet which had been prepared, and the various devices and
emblems with which it had been decorated, under the classical
direction of the vicar, when alas! our publishers, like the harpies of
old, unexpectedly pounced upon us, and warned us from the
feast--“<i>diripiuntque dapes</i>,” as Virgil has it.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You have already exceeded the prescribed limits--you must close the
scene--remember that you have engaged to condense the work into one
volume,” said
<span class='pageno' title='363' id='Page_363'></span>they. We remonstrate, but in vain. We request but a few pages, in order that
we may give our characters a dramatic exit; but they reply to us in
the words of Sneer, in the Critic, “O never mind! so as you get them
off the stage, I’ll answer for it the <i>reader</i> won’t care how.”</p>

<p class='c016'>You see then, gentle reader, how vain it would be to struggle against
such arbitrary and tasteless masters; we shall, therefore, without any
farther apology, ring the manager’s bell, and drop the curtain.</p>

<p class='c030'><span class='pageno' title='364' id='Page_364'></span><i>Preparations for the approaching fête.--The procession of the

<p class='c024'>A month had nearly elapsed since the bridal pair had quitted Overton;
and during this period, the greatest activity had been displayed by
the itinerant corps of Momus, under the superintendence of their
manager, Ned Hopkins. The various show-booths had been erected by
their respective owners with an expedition that might have put many a
prouder architect to shame; the marquees and the temporary rooms had
been completed under the management of Tom Plank; and for those, whose
appetite might hold precedence of the senses of sight and hearing,
ample funds of gratification had been provided by the accomplished
hostess of the “Bag of Nails,” whose grim troop of kettles and
stew-pans had, during the whole of the week, been chirping and
chuckling over the kitchen range, the very cheeks of which had cracked
from yawning. The major now anxiously awaited the arrival of every
post, in expectation of a letter that might announce the day upon
which Henry Beacham and his bride would return to Osterley Park. At
length the long anticipated intelligence was received, that they might
be expected at Overton by four o’clock on the day after the morrow.
The vicar was immediately summoned to a council, and on his arrival,
retired with the
<span class='pageno' title='365' id='Page_365'></span>major for the purpose of consulting the chronicles of Holinshed and
Froissart, touching certain points of ceremonial that might guide them
in their arrangements for receiving the bride. The vicar pleaded in
favour of the forms that were observed on the occasion of the public
entrance of Queen Isabella into the city of Paris, but the major
objected to the plan, on account of the pageant representing the siege
of Troy; a point upon which the vicar, as may be readily imagined,
most pertinaciously insisted; so that the gentlemen separated without
having arrived at any satisfactory conclusion upon the subject, and
the question was transferred to another jurisdiction. No sooner had it
become known that Mr. and Mrs. Beacham were shortly to arrive, than
the more respectable yeomen of the parish assembled at the village
inn, to concert a plan for receiving them with all due honour, when it
was finally arranged, that the village should be decorated with
garlands, and the May-pole erected on the spot, where its gaudy
streamers had for so many ages annually floated on the breeze of
spring. It was farther resolved, that every person who could furnish
himself with a horse, should attend at a certain spot by the hour of
three, in order to advance in procession, and escort the happy couple
through Overton to Osterley Park. The major, upon receiving these
resolutions, issued such orders as might be necessary for carrying
them into effect; he also signified his desire, that those musicians
who had lately arrived for the impending festivities should be in
attendance at the place and hour that had been fixed upon. The friends
of Major Snapwell had already arrived at the Park; and Overton Lodge
was overflowing with visitors. Tom had also joined his family circle.</p>

<p class='c016'>At three o’clock on the appointed day, twenty signal guns were
discharged from the Park--the village bells struck up a festive
peal--the flag was hoisted
<span class='pageno' title='366' id='Page_366'></span>on the spire of the church; and upwards of forty respectable yeomen,
farmers, and tenants, mounted on their horses and decorated with
ribands and flowers, had assembled as an escort.</p>

<p class='c016'>The church clock chimed the quarter past three, as the carriages of
Major Snapwell and Mr. Seymour, and those of their guests, drawn by
highly decorated horses, entered the village; the peasants immediately
drew back, so as to form an avenue through which the party might pass,
while shouts of gladness rent the air. Each horseman had provided a
large bough of oak or elm, so that the cavalcade in motion appeared
like a moving grove, and reminded Mrs. Seymour of the advance of
“Birnam Wood to Dunsinane.” The carriages, preceded by a band of
music, occupied the van of the procession; then came about fifty
village maidens, each carrying in her hand a basket of flowers; next
followed the horsemen; and the procession was closed by a dense group
of peasants, who had come from all the country round. The vicar
appeared on horseback, bustling in all directions, now conversing with
the major, now with Mr. Seymour; at one time moderating the pace of
the horsemen, and at another, keeping back the pedestrians, whose
eagerness to push forward created an inconvenient crowd in the
foremost ranks. Mr. Twaddleton held in his right hand a wand decorated
with ivy leaves, and which resembled in appearance the thyrsus of
Bacchus, except that the cone on its summit had been replaced by a
bunch of roses. This was a classical conceit; and he fully explained
to the major the reason of his having adopted such a device for his
wand of office.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The rose,” said he, “was dedicated by Cupid to Harpocrates, the god
of silence, to engage him to conceal the secrets of Venus; hence has
this flower ever since been considered as the symbol of silence; for
which reason it was customary to hang a rose over
<span class='pageno' title='367' id='Page_367'></span>the banqueting-table, to signify that what was there spoken should be
kept private, or ‘under the rose;’ whence, also, to present, or hold
up, this flower to any person in discourse served, instead of an
admonition, to intimate that it was time for such person to hold his
peace. In like manner,” continued the antiquary, “you will observe
that, by virtue of my wand, I shall impress the obligation of silence
upon the crowd, and easily calm any undue clamour that may arise.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The cavalcade had advanced little more than half a mile, when the
major suggested the propriety of halting, until his nephew and niece
should arrive; to this proposition the vicar readily acceded, and
accordingly issued the necessary orders.</p>

<p class='c016'>They had not, however, remained stationary above five minutes, when a
carriage and four were seen at the brow of the hill, advancing in full
speed. A general and simultaneous shout burst from the crowd; upon
which the vicar raised his wand, and all was hushed. How far such an
effect might be attributed to the influence of his wand, we shall
leave the sagacious reader to determine; but the party smiled at so
striking an instance of classical credulity; and Mr. Twaddleton,
highly gratified by his triumph, rode forward to the chariot, which
was not more than two hundred yards distant. It contained Mr. and Mrs.
Beacham, whom the vicar no sooner perceived, than he again raised his
wand, and again witnessed the influence of its spell. The chariot
instantly stopped, and, in the next moment, Mr. Twaddleton was seen in
earnest conversation with the travellers. He informed them that the
group they saw was a cavalcade of villagers, who had been awaiting
their arrival on the road, in order to escort them in rural triumph to
Osterley Park. He then presented Mr. Beacham with a bag of nuts, “that
the bridegroom,” as he said, “might be enabled to comply with the
<span class='pageno' title='368' id='Page_368'></span>ancient Roman custom<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c017'><sup>[70]</sup></a> of throwing nuts amongst the boys to be
scrambled for;--<i>sparge, marite, nuces</i>, as Virgil has it;--<i>da nuces
pueris</i>, as Catullus sings.” Mr. Beacham held the vicar in too much
respect to laugh at his eccentricities, and he therefore accepted the
bag, with a determination to gratify his wishes in so harmless a whim.</p>

<p class='c016'>Jerry Styles was now directed to forward the two messengers to
Osterley Park; and he accordingly opened a basket, from which flew two
carrier pigeons, who immediately soared into the air, and having
attained their greatest altitude, and remained apparently stationary
for a few seconds, darted off in the direction of Osterley Park; every
eye was steadfastly fixed upon the bird [sic]; and a murmur of
satisfaction and wonder ran through the ranks, as the sagacious
animals lessened in the distance.<a href='#note52'>(52)</a></p>

<p class='c016'>The musicians struck up a grand march;--the whole cavalcade was in
motion. Mr. Beacham’s chariot having been drawn on one side of the
road, the carriages and horsemen proceeded to take their stations in
the rear; the company in the former kissing their hands, and waving
their handkerchiefs, while the latter lowered their branches, and
cheered, as they passed.</p>

<p class='c016'>The damsels, in advance of Mr. Beacham’s carriage, opened their
baskets, and strewed the road with flowers as they moved forward.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='369' id='Page_369'></span>“Hark!” exclaimed the major: “the pigeons have arrived at the park,
and my orders have been faithfully obeyed: they are firing a salute.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And it has been heard at the village,” said the vicar; “for the bells
have just commenced their peal of welcome.” But we are exhausting the
patience of our readers with the details of a ceremony, in which it is
very probable they may feel but little interest; although we freely
confess that, to ourselves, few pageants have such attractive charms
as those innocent and simple manifestations of genuine feeling which
are to be met with in rural life, where the heart has not yet been
chilled by that benumbing influence of what has been termed “the
progress of civilisation;” and which has exchanged the free and warm
impulses of our nature for cold and studied forms, or for an artful
display of factitious sentiment.</p>

<p class='c016'>During the progress of the procession through the village, Mr. Beacham
had not been unmindful of the vicar’s request; he poured a shower of
nuts amongst the boys, which occasioned much frolic, and good-humoured
contention; while the peasants caught and cracked them, without any
suspicion of the Roman custom they were assisting to perpetuate.</p>

<p class='c016'>Having arrived at Osterley Park, the horsemen formed a double line,
through which the several carriages passed. The gates were then
closed; and the vicar, stepping forward, thus addressed the assembled
multitude:--</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well-beloved friends and parishioners, I am desired by Major Snapwell
to inform you that refreshments have been prepared in the village, of
which you may all partake on your return. Your admission into the park
this evening would interfere with those arrangements which are in
progress for to-morrow’s jubilee: let me, therefore, request that you
will all retire peaceably.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='370' id='Page_370'></span>In compliance with this intimation, the whole assembly,</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c043'>
    <div><b>“With tongues all loudness, and with eyes all mirth,”</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c029'>after having given three hearty cheers, retired to the village, where
several barrels of beer had been disposed in readiness for the
libation.</p>

<p class='c016'>The vicar, having completed his harangue, rejoined the party at the
park, where its hospitable owner had prepared a sumptuous dinner. It
was, however, proposed that the vicar, with the major, and such of his
guests as wished to inspect the preparations, should previously walk
round the grounds. Tom and his sisters begged that they might be
included in the party; a request which their father readily granted,
as he said that some opportunity might occur for explaining the nature
of those exhibitions which they were to witness on the following day.
The same feeling induced Mr. and Mrs. Beacham and several other
visitors to join the party, hoping that they also might profit from
the discourse which Mr. Seymour intended to hold for the instruction
of his children. The reader will probably be induced, for similar
reasons, to accompany them. If he has attentively read the preceding
pages of this work, we hope he has become convinced that the lessons
of youth may occasionally convey instruction as well as amusement to
those of riper years.</p>

<p class='c016'>Ned Hopkins having been summoned to attend the party, and receive the
final orders of the vicar, they proceeded to the elm-meadow, where the
grand fair was to be held, and in which were disposed a long line of
booths for the motley exhibitions to which they were dedicated.</p>

<p class='c016'>“What have we here?” exclaimed the major, as he entered the meadow; “a
row of poles!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Ned Hopkins,” cried the vicar, “how has it happened that the ropes
have not been affixed to
<span class='pageno' title='371' id='Page_371'></span>these poles? Have I not said that every arrangement must be completed
this evening? Those poles,” continued the vicar, addressing himself to
Major Snapwell, “are intended for swings, from which the younger
peasants will, doubtless, derive much amusement, while their sires are
engaged, in the adjoining field, by the more manly exercises of
quoits, foot-racing, wrestling, hurling, &amp;c. You are, of course,
aware, gentlemen, that in admitting the swing amongst the pastimes of
the day, I have the support of classical authority: its origin may be
traced to the Icarian games, the celebration of which consisted in
persons balancing themselves on cords attached to two trees; or in
other words, in swinging. They were instituted in commemoration of the
death of Erigone, who no sooner discovered the murder of her father
Icarus, than she piously hung herself at his tomb.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is certainly very curious,” said the major, “to observe how
frequently a popular ceremony or custom has survived the tradition of
its origin; it is thus, for instance, that the fond mother still
suspends the coral toy around the neck of her infant, without being in
the least aware of the superstitious belief from which the custom
sprang <a href='#note53'>(53)</a>; and I have little doubt but that we shall to-morrow hear
the chorus of ‘Derry-down’ re-echoed by those who probably never heard
of the Druids, and much less of the choral hymns with which their
groves resounded, at the time of gathering the misletoe.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You need not go so far back as the Druids,” said Mr. Seymour; “does
not the housewife place the poker across the grate to draw up the
fire, without ever suspecting that the custom originated from the
superstitious belief that, by thus forming a cross with the bars, the
fire was protected from the malignant influence of witches?--But let
us proceed; for what has yonder stage been erected?”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='372' id='Page_372'></span>“That is the <i>hoistings</i>, sir,” exclaimed Ned Hopkins, “from which
Giles Gingerly, the celebrated American merry-andrew, will exhibit his
buffoonery, and vend his nostrums.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Hoistings! why, Ned, you pronounce the word as though your mouth were
filled with hot pudding,” said the major.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I ask your pardon, sir,” replied Ned; “but my father would never
suffer me to pronounce it in any other manner; for he always
maintained that <i>hustings</i> was a corruption for <i>hoistings</i>, it being
a stage upon which the actor is <i>hoisted</i> or elevated above the
surrounding crowd.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I believe he is right,” muttered the vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Papa,” said Tom, “pray tell me what is a merry-andrew.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Ask the vicar,” replied his father.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The mountebank, who united the professions of joculator and
physician, was of ancient date, and during the two last centuries has
figured away with considerable success. He usually appears on a
temporary stage, and prefaces the vending of his nostrums with a
pompous harangue; and, the better to attract the notice of the gaping
spectators, he displays some of the performances practised by the
jugglers, while his inseparable companion, the <i>bourdour</i>, exhibits
numerous tricks, and puts the populace in good humour by wit and
raillery. The medical fraternity, known in England by the name of
<i>Merry-andrews</i>, and who are the companions of the mountebank, derived
their foundation from Dr. Andrew Boorde, who lived in the reigns of
Henry VIII. Edward VI. and Queen Mary, and was constantly in the habit
of frequenting fairs and markets, at which he harangued the populace:
his speeches were extremely humorous, and occasioned considerable
mirth; but, notwithstanding the infallibility of his nostrums, like
Paracelsus, he died with a bottle of his elixir in
<span class='pageno' title='373' id='Page_373'></span>his pocket. His successors in the same line naturally endeavoured to
emulate the humour of their master, and hence this whole class of
vagabond tinkers of flesh and bone acquired the generic appellation of
‘<i>Merry-andrews</i>’.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And pray what are <i>nostrums</i>?” asked Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“‘<i>Nostrum</i>,’ my dear, signifies <i>our own</i>, and is applied to any
medicine which is prepared by a secret process, and sold for the
private advantage of an individual; but, since secrecy is never used
on such occasions except as a cloak for imposture, the word very
generally conveys an expression of ridicule or contempt.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The company proceeded in their inspection.</p>

<p class='c016'>“What have we there, Ned Hopkins?” said Mr. Seymour, as he pointed to
a booth of larger dimensions than those which surrounded it.</p>

<p class='c016'>“In that booth, ‘the Emperor of all the Conjurors’ will perform his
wonderful art of ‘sleight-of-hand,’” replied Ned.--“Look at his card
of invitation,” continued the wag--“<b><span class='xlarge'>☞</span> <span class='sc'>Walk in--walk
in--ladies and gentlemen. Here are miracles in any
quantity to be seen for two-pence, and believed in for nothing</span>!!!</b>”</p>

<p class='c016'>“A lineal descendant of the <i>Tragetour</i> of the fourteenth century,”
observed the vicar; “a class of artists who, with the assistance of
dexterity of execution, and various kinds of machinery, deceived the
eyes of the spectators, and produced such illusions as were usually
supposed to be the effect of enchantment; on which account they were
frequently ranked with magicians, sorcerers, and witches. They were
greatly encouraged in the middle ages, and travelled in large
companies, carrying with them such machinery as was necessary for the
performance of their deceptions.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And what may be the etymology of <i>tragetour</i>?” asked Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='374' id='Page_374'></span>“A late ingenious writer supposes it to be derived from <i>trebuchet</i>, or
<i>trap-door</i>, of which he made frequent use during his performance.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The company passed to the next booth.</p>

<p class='c016'>“There,” said Ned, “will be exhibited vaulting, tumbling, jumping
through hoops, balancing, grotesque dances by the clown, and dancing
upon the tight-rope.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The tragetour rarely executed this part of the performance himself,”
said the vicar, “but left it to some of his confederates.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And yet I should have thought it the most profitable department of
the art,” observed the major; “for it was so patronised as to secure
the reception of its professors into the houses of the nobility. In
the reign of Edward II. a tumbler rode before the King, and so
delighted his Majesty, that he rewarded him with a gratuity of twenty
shillings, a very considerable sum in those days.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The whole party, having expressed their satisfaction at the genius
which Ned Hopkins had displayed in selecting and arranging the various
kinds of amusement, were conducted by the vicar to a small enclosure
at a short distance from the fair, which he had appropriated to the
youths of the village, who had been trained to perform the “<i>Ludus
Trojæ</i>,” according to the description left us by Virgil in the fifth
Æneid.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I shall be curious to witness the sport,” said the major, “for Lazius
asserts, in his commentaries upon the Roman Republic, that the jousts
and tournaments, so much in fashion about two or three hundred years
ago, were indebted for their origin to this game; and that
‘<i>Tournamenta</i>’ is but a corruption of ‘<i>Trojamenta</i>.’”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Undoubtedly,” replied the vicar; “and the learned and noble Du Fresne
entertains the same opinion: by some the word has been derived from
the French <i>tourner</i>, to turn round with agility; yet the
<span class='pageno' title='375' id='Page_375'></span>exercises have so much resemblance, as to prove the one an imitation of the
other.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Come, come, my good friend,” exclaimed the honest major, “all these
preparations are highly laudable, and will, no doubt, afford
satisfaction to the spectators, for whose amusement they have been
designed; but there are other senses, besides the eye and ear, to be
gratified upon this occasion. I have not yet observed any arrangements
for the dinner.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Fear not, major; the awning which has been erected for that purpose
is within sight: observe you not the banners which are floating
yonder?” said the vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Ay, ay, to be sure I do; and let me tell you, that you have taken up
a very snug position.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Tables had been arranged, under an awning of canvass, in the form of a
cross, and were capable of accommodating about two hundred persons. On
a platform, somewhat elevated, was another table appropriated to the
major and his guests, on which covers were laid for forty.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You perceive, major,” said Mr. Twaddleton, as they approached the
scene of future action, “that the fare which has been provided is
simple but substantial, and I trust will be considered as no less
according with English hospitality, than with classical propriety.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The beef certainly predominates,” said the major; “and I observe that
most of the joints are roasted.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Quite correct, sir; the ox is the animal most frequently spoken of,
as furnishing food for ancient heroes; and you will remember that
Homer rarely mentions any other than <i>roasted</i> meat.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I perceive that you have been more miscellaneous in your arrangement
of the upper table.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I have placed before you a chine of beef, because Menelaus set that
dish before Telemachus at the marriage-feast of his son.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='376' id='Page_376'></span>“And I rejoice to see a salad for its neighbour,” said the major.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Ay, truly an <i>Attic</i> salad, with garlic, leeks, and cheese: you no
doubt remember that the poetical salad served up in the comedy of the
Peace of Aristophanes was of this composition,” added the vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I wish to know what seats are to be appropriated to my young friends
the little Seymours?” said the major.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I regret extremely to say, that they cannot with propriety join our
party,” replied the vicar, gravely.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Not join the party! zounds, sir, but I insist upon it;--not join the
party!”--</p>

<p class='c016'>“Be calm, major; and believe me that I shall feel the privation as
keenly as yourself; but would you countenance a measure, which is
decidedly in opposition to every classical authority? Never, as
Suetonius has expressly declared, did the young Cæsars, Caius and
Lucius, eat at the table of Augustus, until they had assumed the <i>toga
virilis</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“A fig for Suetonius; he is not to be trusted: has it not been said,
that, while he exposed the deformities of the Cæsars, he wrote with
all the licentiousness and extravagance with which they lived?
Besides, can we trust the opinion of a man, on a subject of etiquette,
who was banished from the court for want of attention and respect to
the Empress Sabina? You must produce some better authority, my dear
Mr. Twaddleton: search the Grecian writers; depend upon it that some
direct or implied sanction to the plan is to be discovered; the
oracles of old may generally be so interpreted as to meet the wishes
of the translator.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Gently, Major Snapwell; speak not so irreverently of the luminaries
of antiquity; nor expect me to distort passages from their original
and intended significations. An idea, however, has just struck me,
which may, possibly, be turned to your advantage; and yet there are
many difficulties; for it cannot be
<span class='pageno' title='377' id='Page_377'></span>that this feast has been conducted with the utmost frugality; and,
therefore, must not be compared with the Lacedemonian ‘<i>Syssitia</i>,’ or
public entertainments, whither the youths were obliged, by the
lawgiver, to repair as to schools of temperance and sobriety, and
where, by the example and discourse of the elder men, they were
trained to good manners and useful knowledge.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“A case exactly in point,” exclaimed the major. “Must not the
classical character of our entertainment convey instruction? I vow it
runs parallel in every particular with the Syssitia of Lacedemon; and
I therefore affirm, that it would be illegal, according to the law of
Lycurgus, to prevent the presence of the young Seymours.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Your argument has colour, major; I must admit that Mr. Seymour’s
lessons are too valuable to be lost: well, I consent; it shall be a
Lacedemonian entertainment, and my young friends shall be accordingly
accommodated with seats.”</p>

<p class='c016'>On their return from the banqueting-tables, the party inspected the
preparations for the fire-works, and the ships constructed for the
naumachia; we shall, however, at present decline offering any
description, as we prefer explaining them in operation.</p>

<p class='c016'>The reader will now be pleased to imagine that the party having
returned to the mansion, had partaken of the hospitable repast which
the major had provided for them; he may farther suppose that tea had
been served up, and the amusements of the evening commenced; for it is
at this moment that the course of our narrative is resumed. Mrs.
Beacham was delighting the assembly by a splendid display of her
musical talents; the major and Mr. Seymour were engaged in a game of
chess.</p>

<p class='c016'>“There you sit, gentlemen,” exclaimed the vicar, “so absorbed in your
game, as to have remained quite insensible to the sweet sounds with
which Mrs. Beacham has been charming us; but you stand
<span class='pageno' title='378' id='Page_378'></span>excused, for Seneca admits the fascinating power of the ‘<i>ludus
latrunculorum</i>,’ or game of chess. You no doubt remember the story
that he tells us of one Canius Julius, who, having been sentenced to
death by Caligula, was found by the centurion, when he came to conduct
him to execution, so interested in a game of the ‘<i>latrunculi</i>,’ as at
first to be insensible to the summons, and that he did not prepare to
depart until he had counted his men, and desired the centurion to bear
witness to his having one more piece on the board than his adversary,
so that the latter might not boast of a victory after his death.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Indeed!” said the major; “but unfortunately for your story, the
ancients were not acquainted with the game of chess.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“What absurd proposition am I next to expect?” cried Mr. Twaddleton.
“You surely cannot have read the poem to Piso, which some will have to
be Ovid’s, others Lucian’s: but no matter; it is an ancient poem, and
accurately describes the game of ‘<i>latrunculi</i>.’ I myself believe,
from a particular line in Sophocles, that chess was invented by
Palamedes, at the siege of Troy; although Seneca attributes it to
Chilon, one of the seven Grecian sages. My friend Mr. Seymour, who is,
upon all occasions, desirous of imparting wisdom through the medium of
games, and of ‘turning sport into science,’ will no doubt agree with
those who fancy that it was contrived by Pyrrhus, King of Epirus, as a
method of instructing his soldiers in the military art; and I must
admit that the game expresses the chance and order of war so very
happily, that no place can lay so just a claim to its invention as the
camp: ‘<i>ludimus effigiem belli</i>,’<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c017'><sup>[71]</sup></a> as Vida says.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='379' id='Page_379'></span>“Check to your king!” cried the major; “while you are considering of
the best way to get his majesty out of the scrape, I will endeavour to
extricate the vicar out of the quagmire in which he is floundering. My
dear Mr. Twaddleton,” continued the major, “you speak as if it were an
admitted fact that the ‘<i>ludus latrunculorum</i>’ was synonymous with our
chess. I admit that it was a game played with <i>Tesseræ</i> or squares,
and <i>Calculi</i> or pieces; but it does not follow that it must have been
chess; indeed, the learned Dr. Hyde, whose researches into Oriental
games are as much distinguished for accurate discrimination as for
profound scholarship, considers it to have resembled our
<i>draughts</i>.”<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c017'><sup>[72]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c016'>“You are to move, major,” said Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Then I shall take your castle, and open a fresh battery upon the
vicar,” replied Major Snapwell.</p>

<p class='c016'>“So you may,” cried Mr. Twaddleton, “but you will not easily drive me
from my position; supported as I am by Vossius and Salmasius, and an
army of valiant combatants.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The learned Hyde has endeavoured to prove that chess was first
invented in India, and passed from thence to Persia and Arabia.<a href='#note54'>(54)</a>
Fabricius considered it a Persian game, and I must say that I am
inclined to coincide with him. The terms in present use may evidently
be traced to an Oriental source. <i>Schach</i>, in the Persian language,
signifies king, and <i>schachmat</i>, whence our <i>check-mate</i>, the king is
dead, the original words having been transformed by progressive
changes; thus we have <i>schach</i>, <i>echecs</i>, <i>chess</i>; and by a whimsical
concurrence of circumstances, have arisen the English words <i>check</i>,
and <i>exchequer</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I take your <i>queen</i>,” cried Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Ay; and I take a <i>bishop</i> in return,” said the major.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='380' id='Page_380'></span>“Well,” observed the vicar, “if an Oriental nation really gave origin
to the game, it could not, at all events, have been China; since the
policy of that people is to exclude females from every kind and degree
of influence and power, whereas the <i>queen</i> at chess is a powerful and
important piece.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You must not lay too much stress upon the names of the several
pieces,” observed the major, “since they have varied in different ages
and countries. The castle is sometimes called the <i>rook</i>, from the
Italian word <i>rocca</i>, which signifies a fortress placed on a rock: the
piece which we call the <i>Bishop</i> has been termed by English writers
<i>alphan</i>, <i>aufin</i>, &amp;c. from an Arabic word, signifying an elephant;
sometimes it was named an <i>archer</i>; by the Germans, the <i>hound</i> or
<i>runner</i>; by Russians and Swedes, the <i>elephant</i>; by Poles, the
<i>priest</i>; and by the French, at a very early period, the <i>fou</i> or
<i>fool</i>; the reason of this last appellation seems to be, that as this
piece stands on the sides of the king and queen, some wag of the times
styled it the <i>fool</i>, because anciently royal personages were commonly
thus attended, from want of other means of amusing themselves.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You cannot thus account for our term <i>bishop</i>,” observed Mr. Seymour,
“as our kings and queens have never had such attendants.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Nor is it very easy to ascertain the period at which it was
introduced,” replied the major; “in Caxton’s time it was styled the
<i>elphyn</i>. I should think it probable that the change of name took
place after the Reformation.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is probable that the pieces not only underwent changes in name,
but changes in value or power,” observed Mr. Seymour, “as the game
descended through different ages and countries.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mrs. Beacham, who had been for some time listening with much interest
to the curious discourse we have just related, here ventured to ask a
question.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='381' id='Page_381'></span>“As you appear to have taken some trouble to ascertain the origin of
this game, you can perhaps inform me at what period it was introduced
into England.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The major replied, that the learned Hyde supposed it to have been
first known in our country about the time of the Conquest; but that
Mr. Barrington believed it to have been introduced during the
thirteenth century, upon the return of Edward I. from the Holy Land,
where he continued so long, and was attended by so many English.</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is certain that our ancestors played much at chess before the
general introduction of cards,” observed the vicar, “as no fewer than
twenty-six English families have emblazoned chess-boards and
chess-rooks in their arms, and it must therefore have been considered
a valuable accomplishment.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Cards,” observed the major, “must have been known in England previous
to the time of Edward IV.; since a statute was passed in that reign
against their importation; but they did not become general for many
years, and the progress of the custom appears to have been extremely
slow.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Check,--and mate!” exclaimed Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Upon my word, I have lost the game. Mr. Twaddleton, I lay this to
your account,” said the major; “you ought not, sir, to have intruded
your antiquarian discussions at such a time.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You have lost the game, major, because, like Charles XII. of
Sweden,<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c017'><sup>[73]</sup></a> you are too fond of advancing your king; but it is quite
natural that you should feel mortified by your defeat: a person never
likes to be beat at chess, because it is a trial of skill and address;
chance has no place, and no one, therefore, loses except in
consequence of the superiority of
<span class='pageno' title='382' id='Page_382'></span>adversary. You may remember that William the Conqueror, upon being
<i>check-mated</i> by the Prince of France, knocked the chess-board about
his pate, an event which became the source of much future enmity. I
must say,” continued the vicar, “that this, in my view of the matter,
is an imperfection in the game; for, if it be the type or
representative of a military campaign, fortune should have some share
in deciding the fate of the day; and, if I remember correctly, Sir
William Jones has stated that the use of dice, to regulate the moves,
was formerly introduced in the East.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I will give the major his revenge whenever he pleases,” said Mr.
Seymour; “but as I well know how dearly the vicar loves an antiquarian
anecdote, if he will listen I will furnish him with one that will be
probably new to him. Do you observe the form of the chess-board,
resembling, as you perceive, two folio volumes?” said Mr. Seymour.
“The origin of it was this: Endes, bishop of Sully, forbade his clergy
to play at chess. As they were resolved, however, not to obey the
command, and yet did not dare to have a chess-board seen in their
houses or cloisters, they had them bound and lettered as books, and
called them their wooden gospels. These same monks had also drinking
vessels bound to resemble the breviary, and were found drinking when
it was supposed they were at prayers.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='label'><a href='#r70'>70</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Many reasons have been assigned for this custom; the

<p class='c030'><span class='pageno' title='383' id='Page_383'></span><i>The arrival of the populace at Osterley Park.--The commencement
of the festivities.--Dancing on the Tight and Slack
Rope.--Balancing.--Conjuring.--Optical illusions.--Various
games.--The Penthalum.--The Banquet.--Grand display of
Fire-works.--Conclusion.</i></p>

<p class='c024'>Never had the rosy fingers of Aurora shown so much reluctance in
unbarring the gates of the East, as on the morning of the Osterley
Jubilee; at least, so thought about half a score peasants, who,
fevered by anxiety and expectation, had arisen from their beds long
before the break of day.</p>

<p class='c016'>At length, however, the sun arose; but indignant no doubt at the
accusations he had so unjustly suffered, he immediately veiled his
fiery countenance in dark and lowering clouds: here, then, was a fresh
source of doubt and anxiety; would the day be rainy? The gardener at
Overton Lodge was immediately sought and consulted; and cheering as
were his predictions, they scarcely succeeded in dispelling the gloom
which shaded many a fair countenance. The apprehension of
disappointment was, however, suddenly relieved; for between nine and
ten o’clock the sun re-appeared, beaming in all his glory, and
shedding the brightest refulgence on the scene of the approaching
festivities. At this period hundreds of villagers, dressed in their
holiday attire, were seen pouring along the high road, or winding
their way through the verdant valleys. So admirable had been the
arrangements for the admission of the populace into the park, that
great as was the concourse of
<span class='pageno' title='384' id='Page_384'></span>spectators, not the slightest impediment occurred during their entrance.</p>

<p class='c016'>At half-past ten o’clock the whole population of the country had
assembled; the various performers were on their respective stages; and
the arrival of Major Snapwell and his guests was eagerly expected, as
a signal for the commencement of the festivities of the day.</p>

<p class='c016'>At length a distant murmur was heard in the direction of the house,
which gradually increased as it approached the meadow, until it
swelled into one grand and universal chorus. The vicar appeared with
his wand of office, which he no sooner waved in the air than the
murmur gradually subsided. Major Snapwell and his friends, Harry
Beacham and his bride, and the Seymours with their children, and
numerous visitors, followed. The several bands, stationed on the
platforms erected before the show-booths, simultaneously struck up the
national anthem, in which the whole multitude joined, and produced one
of the most surprising and thrilling effects ever witnessed.</p>

<p class='c016'>There were eight booths appropriated to the exhibitions; and it had
been arranged that each should commence at the same time, and repeat
its performances eight times during the day; so that by dividing the
spectators into eight groups, and delivering to each person a ticket
distinguished by a particular number, every spectator at once knew the
booth into which he was to enter; and having witnessed the exhibition,
he was directed to exchange his ticket; by which means every chance of
confusion was avoided, and each person was enabled to witness,
successively, every performance.</p>

<p class='c016'>The vicar and the party entered the first booth, and were followed by
all those whose ticket was distinguished by No. 1.; those of No. 2. at
the same time entered the second booth, and so on.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='385' id='Page_385'></span>The first show was appropriated to the various exhibitions of
vaulting, tumbling, balancing, and rope-dancing. The vicar expressed
high delight on observing that the stage was decorated with branches.
“In the ancient theatre,” said he, “the stage was originally planted
with trees to <i>shade</i> the actors; hence scene, so called from the
Greek word signifying a shade.”<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c017'><sup>[74]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c016'>During the performances of the balancer, Tom Seymour’s attention was
riveted on the artist; he watched every movement, and examined its
effect in preserving the centre of gravity within the base. “Papa,”
cried the delighted boy, “I never experienced so much interest in a
performance of this kind, until I was capable of explaining the
principles upon which it was conducted. I have attentively followed
every change of position, and discovered the effect of such changes
upon the line of direction.”<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c017'><sup>[75]</sup></a> As to the <i>wire-dancing</i>, Tom
observed, that he saw very plainly the swinging of the wire backwards
and forwards diminished the difficulty, and assisted the actor in
keeping his equipoise.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour was highly delighted with these remarks; and, casting an
intelligible look at Mr. Twaddleton, who was seated near him, he
exclaimed, “Well, vicar, you will surely now admit that the pleasures
which arise from sport are heightened by the admixture of science.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“My dear Mr. Seymour,” replied the vicar, “you well know that I have
long since become a convert to your principles; I confess, however,
had that not been the case, the expression of satisfaction and delight
which have just fallen from my little playmate, Tom, would have
removed all my prejudices.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“See, see!” exclaimed Louisa, “how very extraordinary! I declare that
the plate, sword, key, and tobacco-pipe, are all balanced as they
revolve on the chin of the performer.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='386' id='Page_386'></span>“And do you not know, Louisa,” replied Tom, “that the revolution of
the plate and sword, which appears to render the execution so much
more astonishing, actually diminishes the difficulty of the
performance?”<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c017'><sup>[76]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c016'>Thus did Tom Seymour continue to point out successively the
philosophical principles upon which each of the tricks might be
supposed to depend.</p>

<p class='c016'>The next booth into which our party entered was that of Crank Smirky,
the celebrated conjuror, who invited the company to witness his
wonderful display of the art of legerdemain: he was dressed as an
astrologer, with a loose gown of green velvet, and a red cap; he had a
long grey beard, and his nose was bestraddled by a pair of green
spectacles.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Ladies and gentlemen,” said the mystic professor, “I shall have the
honour of convincing you this day, that my single hand is more than a
match for all the sharp eyes of Overton. You will admit that a
beautiful eye makes silence eloquent,--a kind eye, contradiction an
assent,--and an enraged eye, beauty deformed; but my hand shall, by
its magic influence, make eloquence dumb, assent a contradiction, and
deformity beautiful.”</p>

<p class='c016'>So saying, the professor beckoned a villager, who sat near the stage,
to approach and assist him in the performance of his first grand
trick.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Dobby,” exclaimed his terrified wife, “sit thee still; that man has
dealings with the old one; I would not that he should touch your
garment for all the gingerbread in the fair.”</p>

<p class='c016'>This exclamation of the terrified wife set the whole audience in a
roar, and produced a confusion which the skilful conjuror is always
anxious to create, when any sly work is to be performed. In truth,
this scene had been previously concerted by the renowned Crank Smirky,
who had engaged this said Dobby as
<span class='pageno' title='387' id='Page_387'></span>his confederate. A series of very amusing tricks were then performed with
cards and counters; such, for instance, as desiring some person to
draw a card from the pack, and having observed what it was, to return
it; which card, to the wonder of the company, was immediately found in
Dobby’s pocket. Mr. Seymour informed his children that the explanation
of this trick would serve to show the manner in which most of the
deceptions on cards were performed. He said, that the conjuror’s pack
of cards always contained a card, technically termed a ‘<i>brief</i> card,’
or ‘the <i>old gentleman</i>,’ which is one made on purpose by the
card-maker, and is a little larger than any of the rest; the performer
always knows it by feeling it, and can easily force it upon the
unsuspecting drawer; should he, however, attempt to take any other,
the conjuror, under some pretence, shuffles again, till at length he
induces him to take the one intended for him. After the card has been
introduced again into the pack, the performer, without any difficulty,
withdraws it, and the confederate is called upon to produce the
duplicate which had been previously placed in his pocket.</p>

<p class='c016'>The children were told that the several deceptions with coin, or
counters, which they had witnessed, were accomplished by a species of
dexterity acquired only by practice, and termed ‘<i>palming</i>;’ it
consisted in being able to retain a shilling, halfpenny, or counter,
in the palm of the hand, while it remained extended; thus the
performer desires any one to reckon five pieces, which are accordingly
placed on the table before him, the conjuror then takes them up, and
having dexterously palmed one, he adds it to the number as he places
it in the hand of the unsuspecting person.</p>

<p class='c016'>Tom and his sisters expressed themselves much pleased and surprised
with the dexterity of the performer; “But,” added the intelligent boy,
“I should
<span class='pageno' title='388' id='Page_388'></span>be much more gratified by tricks that were indebted for their mystery
to some philosophical principle.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Seymour and the vicar again interchanged looks that strongly
marked the feelings which had been excited by this observation. The
former turning to his son, said, that if he waited patiently, he would
shortly be gratified in that wish, for he knew Crank Smirky was
prepared to exhibit some recreations in divination, that were founded
on the science of numbers.</p>

<p class='c016'>Nor was Mr. Seymour mistaken; for after a few more specimens of his
dexterity, the conjuror requested Mr. Twaddleton, who was sitting
directly in his front, to take an <i>even</i> number of counters in one
hand, and an <i>odd</i> number in the other; and he would tell him, he
said, in which hand he held the even number. Mr. Twaddleton having
complied with the request, he was farther desired to multiply the
number in the right hand by any <i>even</i> number he pleased, as, for
instance, 2; and that in the left hand by an odd number, as 3.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I have done so,” said the vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Then be pleased to add together the two products, and tell me whether
the sum be odd or even.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is odd,” replied Mr. Twaddleton.</p>

<p class='c016'>“If so,” said the conjuror, “the even number of counters will be in
your right hand.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The vicar exposed the counters, and admitted the correctness of the
conjuror’s decision.<a href='#note55'>(55)</a></p>

<p class='c016'>“Ladies and gentlemen,” exclaimed the man of mystery, “I now humbly
crave your silent attention, while I exhibit one of the most wonderful
examples of my art. Here is a ring,--there a shilling,--and there a
glove. I shall presently request each of the three gentlemen before
me, to take one of those articles, so secretly as to prevent the
possibility of my discovering the choice he may have made. I have
here, you perceive, twenty-four counters;
<span class='pageno' title='389' id='Page_389'></span><i>one</i> of which I shall give to you, Mr. Seymour; <i>two</i> to you,
reverend sir; and <i>three</i> to you, my young philosopher; the remaining
eighteen shall remain on the table. Now, gentlemen, I shall retire,
and during my absence, you will be so good as to distribute the three
articles in any way you may think proper.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The professor, accordingly, walked off the stage; when Mr. Seymour
took the ring; the vicar the shilling; and Tom Seymour the glove. The
conjuror, on his return, said that he had one more favour to request,
that the person who had the ring should take from the eighteen
counters on the table as many as he already possessed; the one with
the shilling twice as many; and the person with the glove, four times
as many as he before possessed. The conjuror again retired, in order
that the distribution might be made without his observing it. On
returning, the conjuror, having first cast his eye upon the counters
that remained on the table, informed the company that Mr. Seymour had
taken the ring, Mr. Twaddleton the shilling, and the young gentleman
the glove. The moment the parties assented to this decision, the whole
company expressed their satisfaction and astonishment by thunders of
applause.</p>

<p class='c016'>“That is really very ingenious,” observed the vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>“How could he perform it?” said Tom: “it is evident that his only
guide was the number of counters left on the board.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I understand the process by which it was accomplished, and will
endeavour, at some future time, to explain it,” replied Mr.
Seymour.<a href='#note56'>(56)</a></p>

<p class='c016'>A number of similar tricks followed, all of which depended upon some
algebraical calculation; and the performance was concluded to the
entire satisfaction of all present.</p>

<p class='c016'>The next exhibition was of a very different character:
<span class='pageno' title='390' id='Page_390'></span>it consisted in a variety of optical representations and illusions.
The camera obscura presented a moving picture of the surrounding
scene. The phantasmagoria exhibited a variety of ghastly objects,
which alternately receding from, and approaching the audience, called
forth shrieks of terror and amazement. Amongst the most appalling of
these figures, was the headless horseman of Sleepy Hollow, so
inimitably described in the Sketch Book: it will be remembered that
the body of this trooper having been buried in the church-yard, its
ghost was believed to ride forth every night in quest of its head, and
that the rushing speed with which he passed along the hollow, like a
midnight blast, was owing to his being in a hurry to get back to the
church-yard before day-break. This rapid movement was admirably
represented in the phantasmagoria: at first the figure appeared
extremely diminutive, and at a great distance; but almost immediately
its size became gigantic, and it seemed as if within a few feet of the
audience, and then suddenly vanished. After an instant of utter
darkness, the figure was again visible at a great distance: the
schoolmaster, Crane, was also seen belabouring the starveling ribs of
his steed, old Gunpowder, and quickening his pace towards the very
spot where the spectre was stationed. The whole audience were
breathless with horror. Crane arrived at the bridge, over which the
headless figure opposed his passage. “Mercy upon us!” cried a faint
voice from one of the back seats, “the ghost has found his head, and
is carrying it before him on the pommel of his saddle.”--“Hush, hush!”
cried another voice; Crane’s horse had taken fright; away he dashed
through thick and thin; stones flying and sparks flashing at every
bound. Crane’s flimsy garments fluttered in the air, as he stretched
his long lank body away over his horse’s head, in the eagerness of his
flight. The goblin pressed hard
<span class='pageno' title='391' id='Page_391'></span>upon him; he was not more than a yard behind him, when he was seen to
take up his head, and with gigantic force to hurl it at the pedagogue;
it encountered his cranium with a tremendous crash; he was tumbled
headlong in the dust; the goblin whisked past like a whirlwind, and
the company were once again in total darkness.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Upon my word,” exclaimed Mr. Seymour, “this is one of the most
complete illusions I ever witnessed.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is most ingeniously managed,” said the vicar.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Papa,” cried Tom, “I am quite impatient to learn how so extraordinary
an effect can have been produced. You told me this morning that a
phantasmagoria was nothing more than an improved magic lantern; but
how is it possible for the slides to be so managed as to make the
figures approach and retire from you, and above all, to make them move
their bodies, and throw their arms into different attitudes?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“In the first place, the figures only <i>appear</i> to approach you, for
they are thrown upon a surface which never changes its place; the
whole is therefore an optical illusion, arising from the fact that we
estimate the distance of an object by its apparent magnitude; when,
therefore, the figure began to diminish in size, the mind instantly
assumed that it was receding from the eye; and the illusion was still
farther heightened by the absence of all other objects<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c017'><sup>[77]</sup></a> by which it
might be compared.”</p>

<p class='c016'>At this moment Mr. Seymour was interrupted by the appearance of the
performer who announced his intention of submitting another optical
illusion, which, he trusted, would afford equal satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Papa,” cried Tom, “how much do I regret my ignorance of optics. It is
a great disappointment to
<span class='pageno' title='392' id='Page_392'></span>me that I should witness so many curious exhibitions, without being able
to understand the principles upon which they depend.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I promise you, my dear boy,” replied Mr. Seymour, “that you shall be
instructed in this branch of science during the Christmas vacation.
Enjoy, therefore, the present amusements, and instead of repining at
your ignorance, anticipate the pleasure which you will receive, when
you shall be able to explain them.”</p>

<p class='c016'>A series of extraordinary effects were now exhibited by means of
concave mirrors.<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c017'><sup>[78]</sup></a> Aërial images were produced, so illusive in their
appearance, that the spectators could not believe in their
immateriality, until they attempted to grasp them. In this manner were
presented flowers, fruit, a human skull, and a dagger; the latter of
which terrified the spectator by the sudden and violent manner in
which its point approached him. With this illusion the amusements
concluded; the light of day was admitted; and the performer stepping
forward, announced the termination of his exhibition in the words of
Shakspeare:--</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c043'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><b>“Our revels now are ended: these our actors,</b></div>
      <div class='line in1'><b>As I foretold you, were all spirits, and</b></div>
      <div class='line in1'><b>Are melted into air, into thin air.”</b></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The villagers, as they poured out of the booth, and mingled with their
companions in the fair, with their wonted propensity for the
marvellous, related, in most exaggerated terms, the wonders they had
encountered in the region of shadows. Nothing is swallowed with more
avidity than tales of mystery, especially if spiced with a few grains
of horror; we cannot, therefore, be surprised at the anxiety so
generally
<span class='pageno' title='393' id='Page_393'></span>by those who had not yet witnessed the optical performances to
exchange their tickets for such as would secure their admission into
the popular booth.</p>

<p class='c016'>The next entertainment was a display of ventriloquism, by a pupil of
the celebrated Baron de Mengen.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Now,” said the vicar, “we are to witness a deception upon the ear,
such as we have just seen practised on the eye.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Twaddleton was quite correct in this observation; for,
notwithstanding all the mystery with which the subject has been
invested by credulity, ventriloquism is nothing more than a skilful
modulation of the voice, so as to imitate the gradations of sound, as
they effect the ear in nature under all the circumstances of distance
and obstruction; in short, imposing upon the ear as a perspective
painting does upon the eye.</p>

<p class='c016'>The crowd which had assembled round the spot was now dispersed by the
appearance of a placard, announcing the suspension of all the
performances for two hours; and informing the populace that the
interval would be devoted to various sports and pastimes in the
adjoining field.</p>

<p class='c016'>The revellers accordingly hastened to the spot where the several
sports were to take place, and to which they were directed by the
sound of a bugle.</p>

<p class='c016'>We have stated that a small enclosure had been prepared for the youths
of the village, who were to perform the “<i>ludus Trojæ</i>,” or Troy game.
The major and his party had taken possession of the seat, placed for
their accommodation under an awning; and the boys, classically
dressed, and furnished with little arms and weapons, were mustered in
<i>circo</i>. Each youth was mounted on a pony; and the troop having rode
round the ring, and surveyed the spectators, the vicar arose from his
seat, and, like the
<span class='pageno' title='394' id='Page_394'></span>sage Epytides, gave the signal of attack by a crack of the whip. They now
arranged themselves in two battalions, and hurling their javelins with
an air of proud defiance, wheeled and charged, and urged the sportive
war; at the conclusion of the game, the vicar called the principal
youth, or “<i>princeps juventutis</i>,” and presented him with a basket of
fruit, which he desired him to divide amongst his companions.</p>

<p class='c016'>The populace now separated into different groups; one party proceeded
to witness a wrestling-match; another to see the foot-race; a third to
be present at a match of quoits; for the vicar had provided all these
games, in imitation of the ancient <i>Penthalum</i> or <i>Quinquertium</i>.
While observing the game of quoits, the vicar displayed much classical
erudition; he said that Homer had represented Ajax and Ulysses as
greatly skilled in the sport; and that Ovid, when he brings in Apollo
and Hyacinth playing at it, had given a very elegant description of
the exercise.<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c017'><sup>[79]</sup></a> Scaliger, he continued, is of opinion, that the
throwing the <i>discus</i>, or quoit, is but an improvement of the old
sport of casting the sheep-hook; a conjecture which, the vicar
thought, received some support from a passage in the fourth Iliad.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Mr. Twaddleton,” cried Mr. Seymour, “you look at every sport with the
eye of a classic or antiquary; I, on the other hand, as you well know,
cautiously examine every action, to discover whether some scientific
principle may not find an illustration. On the present occasion, I am
desirous of directing the attention of the children to the manner in
which yonder skilful player hurls his quoit.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I do not exactly comprehend the object they have in view in throwing
the quoits,” said Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Do you not perceive that two iron pins, or <i>hobs</i>, are driven into
the ground, at the distance of
<span class='pageno' title='395' id='Page_395'></span>eighteen or twenty yards asunder?” asked her father.</p>

<p class='c016'>“To be sure, and I suppose that each player attempts to hit one of
those pins.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The players stand at one of the <i>hobs</i>, and throw an equal number of
quoits at the other; the nearest of them to the hob are reckoned
towards the game. When they have cast all their quoits, the candidates
go over to the point at which they have been throwing, and when they
have determined the state of the game, they throw their quoits back
again at the hob where they had before stood; and thus continue to
act, on alternate sides, till the game is ended.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I now understand it,” cried Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You doubtless know, Mr. Twaddleton,” said Mr. Seymour, “that the
casting of stones, darts, and other missiles, was among the amusements
practised in the twelfth century by the young Londoners.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“<i>Casting of the bar</i>,” replied the vicar, “was formerly a part of a
hero’s education; and kings and princes were admired for their agility
and grace in throwing ‘the stone, the bar, and the plummet.’ Henry the
Eighth, even after his accession to the throne, retained the casting
of the bar among his favourite amusements. The sledge-hammer, and,
among rustics, an axle-tree, were also used for the same purpose as
the bar and the stone.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The game of quoits is certainly far superior to such pastimes,” said
Mr. Seymour, “on account of its depending less on mere strength, and
more upon superior skill.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Did not you say, papa, that its action would illustrate some
principle of science? I have been looking at the quoit, which I
perceive is a circular piece of iron with a hole in the middle, but I
cannot discover in what manner any scientific principle can be
connected with its motion.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“If you will attentively observe a skilful player,
<span class='pageno' title='396' id='Page_396'></span>you will perceive that he steadies the flight of the quoit, by imparting
to it a spinning motion; were he not thus to <i>rifle</i> it, you would
find that it would fly very far from the mark.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Upon the same principle, I suppose, that we impart to the ball a
spinning motion at the game of <i>bilboquet</i>?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Precisely so,” replied her father, who also stated that the body was
made to rotate on its shortest axis, for the reasons before
explained.<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c017'><sup>[80]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c016'>The “<i>penthalum</i>” having been concluded, the populace retired into
several booths which were appropriated to refreshments. The shows then
re-commenced; those not already described were principally devoted to
the exhibition of wild animals, an entertainment which the vicar
considered as sanctioned by the highest classical authority; although
he, at once, rejected a proposition made by the major, to render the
amusement still more in accordance with ancient custom, by encouraging
a fight between a lion and a tiger.</p>

<p class='c016'>The hour had now arrived for the grand banquet; and, by the command of
the major, the band paraded the fair, playing the inviting tune of
“Oh, the roast beef of Old England.” The populace hastened to the
tent, and each took his place according to the number upon his ticket.</p>

<p class='c016'>We shall not detain our readers by an account of the dinner; it will
be sufficient to state, in the language generally used upon such
occasions, that the whole went off with great eclat, and gave
universal satisfaction to the delighted guests.</p>

<p class='c016'>For the amusement of his military friends, the major had made
arrangements for reviving the ancient game of quintain. It may be
necessary to state that the quintain is a pastime of high antiquity.
It was originally nothing more than the trunk of a tree, or
<span class='pageno' title='397' id='Page_397'></span>a post set up for the practice of young beginners in chivalry.
Afterwards a staff, or spear, was fixed in the earth, and a shield,
hung upon it, was the mark to strike at. The dexterity of the
performer consisted in smiting the shield in such a manner as to break
the fastening and to bring it to the ground. In process of time, this
diversion was much improved; instead of the staff and shield, a
grotesque wooden figure was introduced, and it was so contrived to
move upon a pivot, that if it were struck unskilfully, it would turn
out and give the performer a severe blow. The quintain which the major
had prepared for the present occasion consisted of a wooden figure,
fixed upon a pivot, and holding in its outstretched arm a bag of
flower. Those who ran at it, and missed it, were of course laughed at;
while those who struck the figure full with his lance gave the beam a
sudden whirl; and unless he was very nimble, was covered with flower
from the bag which was thus brought into contact with him.</p>

<p class='c016'>The reader must now be contented to retire from the scene of frolic,
and leave the villagers to the undisturbed enjoyment of their jollity.
The major and his party returned to the house, where they remained
until the hour approached at which the fire-works were to be
discharged, and the festivities of the day concluded. Mr. Seymour
accompanied his children to the stage, erected for the pyrotechnic
exhibition, in order that he might explain the construction of the
fire-works before they witnessed them in action.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Upon my word, the major has provided most liberally for our
entertainment!” exclaimed Mr. Seymour, as he ascended the steps which
led to the platform. “I declare there is a forest of <i>rockets</i>! and
what magnificent <i>Pin-wheels, Tourbillions, Marroons, Pots des
Aigrettes, Gerbes, Courantins, and Roman Candles</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Are those paper cylinders, with long sticks, rockets?” enquired Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='398' id='Page_398'></span>“They are; and if you will attend to me, I will explain the principle
of their construction. They have ever been considered as holding the
first place amongst single fire-works, and deservedly so; not only on
account of the splendid appearance they present when fired by
themselves, but from their extensive application in increasing the
beauty of other exhibitions. The rocket, you perceive, consists of a
strong paper cylinder, which is filled with a suitable composition; it
is crowned with a head, or ‘<i>pot</i>,’ as it is technically termed,
charged with various materials, which throws out sparks, stars, and
other decorations, as soon as it takes fire in the air, after the body
of the rocket has been consumed. You may observe that the head is made
to terminate in a point, which greatly facilitates its passage through
the air. The whole is affixed to a straight stick, which, like the
rudder of a ship, makes it turn to that side towards which it is
inclined, and consequently causes the rocket to ascend in a straight
line.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“But, papa,” observed Louisa, “all the rockets have not straight rods;
see, there is one, with a crooked stick.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“That is for the purpose of causing the rocket to ascend in the form
of a screw: the first effect of the bent rod will be to make the
rocket incline towards that side to which it is bent; but its centre
of gravity bringing it afterwards into a vertical situation, the
result of these two opposite efforts will be, that the rocket will
ascend in a zig-zag or spiral form. In this case, however, since it
displaces a greater volume of air, and describes a longer line, it
will not ascend so high as if it had been impelled in a straight
direction; but I think you will admit that, on account of the
singularity of this motion, it produces a very agreeable effect.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And what causes the rocket to ascend into the air?” asked Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='399' id='Page_399'></span>“It is a subject which has engaged the attention of several most
distinguished philosophers; the explanation, however, offered by Dr.
Hutton appears to me to be the most satisfactory. He says, ‘that at
the moment when the powder begins to inflame, its expansion produces a
torrent of elastic fluid, which acts in every direction; that is,
against the air which opposes its escape from the cartridge, and
against the upper part of the rocket; but the resistance of the air is
more considerable than the weight of the rocket, on account of the
extreme rapidity with which the elastic fluid issues through the neck
of the rocket to throw itself downwards, and therefore the rocket
ascends by the excess of the one of these forces over the other.’”</p>

<p class='c016'>Tom observed, that he thought Dr. Hutton’s explanation very simple and
plausible.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Dr. Hutton adds,” continued Mr. Seymour, “that the rocket could not
rise unless a sufficient quantity of elastic fluid were produced, and
hence arose the expedient of piercing the rocket with a conical hole,
so as to make the composition burn in conical strata, which, having
much greater surface, produce a much greater quantity of inflamed
matter and elastic fluid. Without such a contrivance, the composition
would inflame only in circular coats of a diameter equal to that of
the rocket; and experience has shown that this is not sufficient for
the purpose. Some years ago a plan was suggested for producing the
propulsion of a vessel in this way; by the force of a steam-engine, a
stream of water was to be shot out of the stern, the impulse of which,
upon the water in the river, was to push forward the boat. It is a
curious fact, that Nature has employed the same expedient for the
motion of some aquatic insects. The larva of the dragon-fly, according
to Adams, swims forward by ejecting water from its tail.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“What are those fire-works, attached to the lines?” asked Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='400' id='Page_400'></span>“Those, my dear, are line-rockets, or <i>courantines</i>,<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c017'><sup>[81]</sup></a> and which,
instead of rising into the air, run along the line, to which they are
attached by means of a hollow cylinder. Their motion is to be
explained upon the same principle as that of the sky-rocket; a force
is generated by the escape of elastic matter, and as the rocket is
confined to the rope, it is made to run along the line, instead of
ascending into the air.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“That is clear enough,” said Louisa; “but see, papa, there is the
figure of a dragon on yonder rope!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“That is merely a runner for the courantine, which is constructed in
that form, for the purpose of rendering the exhibition more
surprising. I dare say it is filled with various compositions, such as
golden rain, and fires of different colours, which will greatly
heighten the effect: indeed this pyrotechnic amusement may be
infinitely varied.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Are not those <i>pin-wheels</i>, which are elevated above the railing?”
said Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Yes; they are pin or Catharine wheels, and if you will look at them,
you will perceive that they are of very simple construction;
consisting merely of a long paper tube, filled with inflammable
matter, and rolled round a small circle of wood, so as to form a helix
or spiral line.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The circle of wood, I suppose, is pierced in the middle for the
purpose of receiving a pin, by which the wheel is attached to the
post,” said Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Exactly so; and the cause of their revolution is the same as that
which produces the flight of the rocket; the impulse of the air forces
back the ignited part of the wheel, which generates, as it were, a
centrifugal force, while the attachment of the pipe, by preventing its
obeying such a force, may be said to represent the centripetal force,
and thus is the revolution of the wheel continued, until the whole of
the composition is consumed.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='401' id='Page_401'></span>“I think you told us, when speaking of the thaumatrope,<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c017'><sup>[82]</sup></a> it was the
rapidity with which the flame revolved, that occasioned the star-like
appearance which is exhibited by this fire-work,” observed Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Undoubtedly, my dear; it cannot be otherwise.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The party now examined the remaining specimens of the pyrotechnic art.
Mr. Seymour informed them that <i>marroons</i> were nothing more than small
cubical boxes, filled with a composition proper for making them burst,
and thence producing a loud report. He said that they were principally
used in combination with other pieces, or to form a battery, in which,
by different lengths of quick match, they were made to explode at
distinct intervals. Mr. Seymour added, that when the cases were made
cylindrical, instead of being cubical, they exchanged the name of
marroon for that of <i>saucisson</i>. Louisa enquired the nature of certain
cylindrical cases she observed on the stage, and was informed that
they were <i>gerbes</i>, a species of fire-work, which throws up a luminous
and sparkling jet of fire, and from a supposed resemblance to a
water-spout, has derived the appellation of <i>gerbe</i>. Mr. Seymour next
pointed out to Tom a row of <i>Roman candles</i>, some of which were fixed
quite perpendicular, others inclining at different angles, so that the
balls might be projected to various distances, and thus produce a more
varied effect. He observed, that, to his taste, it was by far the most
beautiful fire-work ever exhibited.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I am quite impatient for the exhibition,” cried Tom; “pray, papa,
what is the hour? I think it was determined to let them off at ten
o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is now about eight o’clock; we will, therefore, return to the
house: we shall, however, I suspect, have a curious sight to witness
in our way
<span class='pageno' title='402' id='Page_402'></span>through the fair; for by this time every booth is illuminated.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The scene was indescribably beautiful, and might be said to resemble
an enchanted island. The trees were lighted up with an endless
profusion of Chinese lanterns, of various colours, and decorated with
fantastic transparencies, which produced an effect highly graceful and
pleasing. The booths were richly studded with lights; and, near the
platform, on which the villagers were enjoying the country dance, was
erected a pyramid, which blazed with several hundred variegated lamps.</p>

<p class='c016'>At ten o’clock the commencement of the fire-works was announced by a
shower of rockets. The music ceased; and the dancers, together with
the spectators who had gathered around the platform, hastened to the
spot, whither they were summoned by the sound of trumpets, to witness
the pyrotechnic entertainment which was to crown the festivities of
the day.</p>

<p class='c016'>The little Seymours had been stationed by their father in the most
favourable spot for seeing the exhibition; and highly were the major
and his party delighted with the observations which fell from the
intelligent children on the occasion.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Observe, Louisa, the rocket as it ascends describes a parabola,”<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c017'><sup>[83]</sup></a>
cried Tom.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Oh, how extremely beautiful! see, the head has burst, and is
discharging a number of brilliant stars! What is that red spark which
is now falling to the ground, papa?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“That is the ignited stick of the rocket,” replied his father.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='403' id='Page_403'></span>“Take care, Louisa, do not hold your face up,” exclaimed Tom; “for as
the rocket bursts over our heads, the stick may fall upon us.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I scarcely expected such an observation from you, Tom,” said his
father, “after the sensible remark you just made respecting the
parabolic path of the rocket; do not you remember, that when a
projectile has reached its greatest altitude, it will descend in a
curve similar to that in which it ascended?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“True, true,” answered Tom; “I see my error; the stick must, of
course, fall at a considerable distance from us.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Look! look!! There goes a <i>courantine</i>: how it ran along the rope!”
exclaimed Louisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>“There goes another!” cried Tom; “and see, it is the dragon; and I
declare there is another running in an opposite direction;--they meet.
Look at the serpents which they discharge from their mouths! Now they
return to the extremity of the line with great violence. What an
explosion!!!”</p>

<p class='c016'>In like manner were next exhibited two ships, which, being filled with
serpents, were made to pour their broadsides at each other.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I never saw better courantines in my life,” said Mr. Seymour; “the
major really conducts the exhibition with great skill; it does him
infinite credit as an engineer.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“See--see, papa! what a large wheel of fire!” exclaimed Tom, “and the
figure of a man in the centre.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“A classical device of the vicar beyond all doubt. It is Ixion on a
wheel encompassed by hissing serpents,” observed his father.</p>

<p class='c016'>This conjecture was soon verified, for the vicar with his usual
animation was heard to exclaim--</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c043'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><b>________“tortosque Ixionis angues,</b></div>
      <div class='line'><b>Immanemque rotam,”</b></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c029'>as Virgil has it.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='404' id='Page_404'></span>Another shower of rockets succeeded, and the air resounded with the
applause of the populace.</p>

<p class='c016'>(Bang)--(bang)--(bang)--</p>

<p class='c016'>“There go the marroons,” said Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>The band now struck up a march, and the major completely succeeded, by
having arranged different lengths of quick match, in making them
explode at appropriate intervals, so as to mark correctly the
commencement of each bar of the music which was performing.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Bravo! bravo!” exclaimed Mr. Seymour; “had Handel witnessed such an
effect, he would have engaged the major as a performer in his grand
choruses.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“See! what a beautiful fountain of fire--there! now a most brilliant
star is ejected!”--</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is a Roman candle,” said Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p class='c016'>A variety of different rockets were next exploded; such as “<i>Towering</i>
rockets,” so called from their ascending to a greater height than any
others; an effect which is produced by fixing a smaller rocket on the
top of another of superior dimensions; “<i>Honorary</i> rockets,” which,
when they attain their greatest height, communicate fire to other
rockets affixed to them in a transverse direction, and thus produce a
rapid revolution, and represent, on their return to the ground, a
spiral of descending fire; “<i>Caduceus</i> rockets,” so called from their
resemblance, when in action, to the rod borne by Mercury: the effect
is produced by firing two rockets obliquely on the opposite sides of a
rod, so that they shall form in their flight two spiral lines.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is not necessary to enumerate the series of beautiful exhibitions
which succeeded; we shall only add, that the concluding fire-work was
a Catharine-wheel of imposing splendour. After having repeatedly
changed its device and colours during its revolution, it at length
exploded and threw out a group of serpents; the dense volume of smoke
which followed this explosion, gradually cleared off, and the
appropriate
<span class='pageno' title='405' id='Page_405'></span>motto of “<span class='fss'>FAREWELL</span>,” appeared in brilliant letters of red fire.</p>

<p class='c016'>In a few minutes, the populace began to separate; they had, however,
scarcely arrived at the gate of the park, when a large rocket
ascended, and bursting over their heads, discharged a parachute, to
which was attached a brilliant light; eight similar rockets were
successively fired, and with the same effect. The major had
ingeniously contrived, by varying the angle, to disengage the floating
luminaries in the form of a crown or circle, which threw a blazing
light over the whole country; nor did it fade until sufficient time
had been allowed for the return of the villagers to their respective
homes.</p>

<p class='c016'>Should our readers have fortunately been infected with a portion of
that good humour and hilarity which elated the hearts of the
spectators upon this memorable occasion, we may conclude our labours
with the cheering hope that they will receive a favourable reception
at the tribunal of public opinion.</p>

<p class='c016'><a href='#r83'>83</a>. A scientific critic has offered the following just
remark upon this passage. “The rocket ascends by a constantly acting
force, not by a momentary impulse, as though it were shot from a gun.
Supposing the force arising from combustion to be proportionate to the
weight of the rocket, as long as the force continues to be generated,
the rocket must move in a straight line; after which, having only its
own momentum to oppose its gravitation, it will proceed in a parabolic
curve.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>The Horologe of Flora</span> is alluded to by Pliny with his usual felicity
of thought and expression. “Dedi tibi herbas horarum indices; et ut ne
sole quidem oculos tuos a terra avoces, heliotropium ac lupinum
circumaguntur cum illo. Cur etiam altius spectas, ipsumque cœlum
scrutatis? Habes ante pedes tuos ecce Vergilias.”--<i>Hist. Nat.</i> lib.
xviii. c. 27.</p>

<p class='c016'>Linnæus enumerates forty-six flowers which possess this kind of
sensibility. The following are a few of them, with their respective
hours of rising and setting, as the Swedish naturalist terms them. He
divides them into <i>meteoric</i> flowers, which less accurately observe
the hour of unfolding, but are expanded sooner or later, according to
the cloudiness, moisture, or pressure of the atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c016'>2nd. <i>Tropical</i> flowers, which open in the morning, and close before
evening every day; but the hour of the expanding becomes earlier or
later, as the length of the day increases or decreases.</p>

<p class='c016'>3rd. <i>Equinoctial flowers</i>, which serve for the construction of
Flora’s dial, since they open at a certain and exact hour of the day,
and for the most part close at another determinate hour: for instance,
the <i>Leontodon Taraxacum</i>, dandelion, opens at 5-6, closes at 8-9;
<i>Hieracium Pilosella</i>, mouse-ear hawkweed, opens at 8, closes at 2;
<i>Tragopogon pratensis</i>, yellow goat’s-beard, opens at sunrise, and
shuts at noon with such regularity, that the husbandman who adopts it
as the signal of dinner-time need not fear to have his pudding too
much or too little boiled; <i>Sonchus lævis</i>, smooth sow-thistle, opens
at 5, closes at 11-12; <i>Lactuca sativa</i>, cultivated lettuce, opens at
7, closes at 10; <i>Tragopogon luteus</i>, yellow goat’s-beard, opens at

    <div><a id='note2' name='note2' />Note 2, p. <a href='#Page_32'>32</a>.--<span class='sc'>Gravity and centrifugal force</span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>It may, perhaps, be asked how this decrease of weight could have been
ascertained; since, if the body under examination decreased in weight,
the weight which was opposed to it in the opposite scale must also
have diminished in the same proportion; for instance, that if the lump
of lead lost two pounds, the body which served to balance it must also
have lost the same weight, and therefore that the different force of
gravity could not be detected by such means. It is undoubtedly true
that the experiment in question could not have been performed with an
ordinary pair of scales, but by using a spiral spring it was easy to
compare the force of the lead’s gravity at the surface of the earth,
and at four miles high, by the relative degree of compression which it
sustained in those different situations. We may take this opportunity
of observing, that as the force of gravity varies directly as the
mass, or quantity of matter, a body weighing a pound on our earth
would, if transferred to the sun, weigh 27-3/4 pounds; if to Jupiter,
<span class='pageno' title='411' id='Page_411'></span>3-1/10 pounds; if to Saturn, 1-1/9; but, if to the moon, more than three
ounces.</p>

<p class='c016'>With respect to the effect of the centrifugal force as alluded to in
the text, it may be here observed, that it has been found by
calculation that, at the equator, the diminution of gravity occasioned
by the centrifugal force arising from the rotation of the earth,
amounts to about the 289th part. But since this number is the square
of 17, it follows, that, if our globe turned more than 17 times faster
about her axis, or performed the diurnal revolution within the space
of 84 minutes, the centrifugal force would predominate over the powers
of gravitation, and all the fluid and loose matters would, near the
equinoctial boundary, have been projected from the surface. On such a
supposition the waters of the ocean must have been drained off, and an
impassable zone of sterility interposed between the opposite
hemispheres. By a similar calculation, combined with that decreasing
force of gravity at great distances from the centre, it may be
inferred, that the altitude of our atmosphere could never exceed
26,000 miles. Beyond this limit, the equatorial portion of air would
have been shot into indefinite space. If it were possible to fire off
a cannon ball with a velocity of five miles in a second, and the
resistance of the air could be taken away, it would for ever wheel
round the earth, instead of falling upon it; and supposing the
velocity to reach the rate of seven miles in a second, the ball would
fly off from the earth, and be never heard of more.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>It is scarcely possible so to strain the imagination as to conceive
the velocity with which light travels. “What mere assertion will make
any man believe,” asks Sir W. Herschel, “that in one second of time,
in one beat of the pendulum of a clock, a ray of light travels over
192,000 miles, and would therefore perform the tour of the world in
about the same time that it requires to wink with our eyelids, and in
much less than a swift runner occupies in taking a single stride?”
Were a cannon ball shot directly towards the sun, and it were to
maintain its full speed, it would be twenty years in reaching it, and
yet light travels through this space in seven or eight minutes.</p>

    <div><a id='note4' name='note4' />Note 4, p. <a href='#Page_36'>36</a>.--<span class='sc'>Velocity of falling bodies</span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='412' id='Page_412'></span>In order to perform this experiment with the highest degree of
accuracy, a body of considerable specific gravity should be selected,
such as lead or iron; for a common stone experiences a considerable
retardation in falling, from the action of the air. Where the arrival
of the body at the bottom of the cavern to be measured cannot be seen,
we must make allowance in our calculation for the known velocity of
sound; thus, suppose a body were ascertained to fall in five seconds.
As a heavy body near the earth’s surface falls about 16-1/12 feet in
one second of time, or for this purpose 16 feet will be sufficiently
exact; and as sound travels at the rate of 1142 feet per second,
multiply together 1142, 16, and 5, which will give 91360, and to four
times this product, or 365440, add the square of 1142, which is
1304164, and the sum will be 1669604; then if from the square root of
the last number = 1292 the number 1142 be subtracted, the remainder
150 divided by 32 will give 4.69 for the number of seconds which
elapsed during the fall of the body; if this remainder be subtracted
from 5, the number of seconds during which the body was falling and
the sound returning, we shall have 0.31 for the time which the sound
alone employed before it reached the ear; and this number multiplied
by 1142, will give for product 354 feet equal the depth of the well.
This rule, which, it must be allowed, is rather complex, is founded on
the property of falling bodies, which are accelerated in the ratio of
the times, so that the spaces passed over increase in the square of
the times.</p>

<p class='c016'>The following is a more simple but less accurate rule. Multiply 1142
by 5, which gives 5710; then multiply also 16 by 5, which gives 80, to
which add 1142, this gives 1222, by which sum divide the first product
5710, and the quotient 4.68 will be the time of descent, nearly the
same as before. This taken from 5, leaves 0.32 for the time of the
ascent; which, multiplied by 1142, gives 365 for the depth, differing
but little from the former more exact number.</p>

<p class='c016'>This superstition still prevails in many parts of England, especially
in Cornwall, where the peasants on certain days of the year assemble
at the springs, or holy wells, and, in
<span class='pageno' title='413' id='Page_413'></span>the manner stated in the text, proceed to settle such doubts and
enquiries as will not let the idle and anxious rest. Here, therefore,
they come, and, instead of allaying, deservedly feed their uneasiness;
the supposed responses serving equally to increase the gloom of the
low-spirited, the suspicions of the jealous, and the passion of the
enamoured. The superstition, however, is sanctioned by the highest
antiquity. The Castalian fountain, and many others among the Grecians,
were supposed to be of a prophetic nature. By dipping a fair mirror
into a well, the Patræans of Greece received, as they supposed, some
notice of ensuing sickness or health from the various figures
portrayed upon the surface. In Laconia they cast into a pool, sacred
to Juno, cakes of bread-corn; if they sank, good was portended; if
they swam, something dreadful was to ensue. Sometimes they threw three
stones into the water, and formed their conclusions from the several
turns they made in sinking. “From the several waves and eddies which
the sea, river, or other water exhibited,” says Dr. Borlase, “when put
into agitation after a ritual manner, the ancients pretended to
foretell with great certainty the event of battles; a way of divining
recorded by Plutarch in his life of Cæsar, and still usual among the
vulgar in Cornwall; who go to some noted well, at particular times of
the year, and there observe the bubbles that rise, and the aptness of
the water to be troubled, or to remain pure, on their throwing in pins
or pebbles, and thence conjecture what shall or shall not befall them.
The Druids also, as we have great reason to think, pretended to
predict future events, not only from holy wells and running streams,
but from the rain and snow water, which, when settled, and afterwards
stirred, either by oak-leaf or branch, or magic wand, might exhibit
appearances of great information to the quick-sighted Druid, or seem
so to do to the credulous enquirer, when the priest was at full
liberty to represent the appearances as he thought most for his
purpose.”--<span class='sc'>Borlase’s</span> <i>Antiquities of Cornwall</i>, p. 140.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the islands of Scilly there is, or was some years since, a custom
of propitiating fortune by certain ceremonies of this kind. An old
islander regretted to a friend of the author the want of care with
which such ceremonies had of late been conducted, and observed, as the
consequence, that “<i>they had no luck at all in the islands; not a
wreck had taken place for many months</i>.”</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='414' id='Page_414'></span>The Latin word <i>moneta</i>, for money, is probably more modern than
<i>pecunia</i>, and is said to be derived from <i>moneo</i>, to advise or mark,
that is, to show by some mark the weight and fineness of the metal of
which coins were composed. Thus, according to Isidorus, “Moneta ita
appellatur, quia monet nè qua fraus in pondere vel metallo fiat.” The
origin of money seems to have been coeval with the first regulations
of civil society, or, at least, it is too remote to be traced by any
authentic history. Barter, that is the exchange of one commodity for
another, was the ordinary mode of traffic in the earlier periods of
the world; a practice which must soon have been discovered extremely
inconvenient, and inadequate to the purposes of commerce; and hence
the invention of a common measure, or standard, according to which all
other things should be estimated. Writers very generally agree in
believing that the metals were first used for such a purpose, as being
almost the only substances whose goodness, and as it were integrity,
were not injured by partition; and which admitted of being melted, and
returned again into a mass of any size or weight. At first, it is
probable that each person cut his metal into pieces of different sizes
and forms, according to the quantity to be given for any merchandize,
or according to the demand of the seller, or the quantity stipulated
between them; to this end they went to market, laden with metal, in
proportion to the purchase to be made, and furnished with instruments
for apportioning it, and with scales for dealing it out, according as
occasion required. By degrees it must have been found commodious to
have pieces ready weighed; and Mr. Pinkerton observes, that such were
prepared without any stated form or impression, but merely regulated
to a certain weight; for <i>weight</i> was the grand standard of ancient
coinage, so that all large sums were paid in weight, even down to the
Saxon period of England. As in Greece the first estimation of money
was merely by weight, so was it in Rome. Silver was the metal first
used in Grecian coinage, but copper in the Roman; the former metal
having been long known to the Romans. The first valuation of Roman
money was by the <i>libra gravis æris</i>, or pound of heavy brass: and
when by the progress of their conquests they obtained silver and gold,
these were regulated
<span class='pageno' title='415' id='Page_415'></span>in the same manner. Let us proceed one step farther in the history of
coins; it is easy to imagine that the growing commerce of money being
disturbed with frauds, both in the weight and the material, the
interposition of public authority became necessary, and that hence
arose the first stamps or impressions of money; to which succeeded the
names of the moneyers, and at length the effigy of the prince, the
date, legend, and other precautions to prevent the alteration of the
species; and thus were coins completed. Gold and silver, in their pure
or unmixed state, are too flexible to make coins sufficiently firm for
general use; and hence the necessity of mixing with them a certain
proportion of some harder metal, and this mixture is called the
<i>alloy</i>. The quality of this alloy has been always considered of great
importance with respect to the durability of coins. The most common
metal used for this purpose is copper; and sometimes, for gold, a
mixture of silver and copper. In all well-regulated governments, there
has been a standard fixed by law; that is, a certain proportion
between the quantity of pure metal and its alloy. In England the
standard for gold is 11/12, that is eleven parts of pure metal, and
one part of alloy. The standard for silver is 37/40, a proportion
which is said to have been fixed in the reign of Richard I. by certain
persons from the eastern parts of Germany, called <i>Easterlings</i>; and
hence the word <i>Sterling</i>, which was afterwards the name given to the
silver penny, and which is now applied to all lawful money of Great
Britain.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Penny</i> is derived by Camden from <i>pecunia</i>, but others suppose that
the word is formed from <i>pendo</i> to weigh, and the word has been
sometimes written, according to this origin, <i>pending</i>. The ancient
English penny, or penig, or pening, was the first silver coin struck
in England, and the only one current amongst our Saxon ancestors.
Until the time of Edward I. the penny was struck with a cross so
deeply indented in it that it might be easily broken, and parted into
two pieces, thence called <i>half-pennies</i>, or into four, called
<i>four-things</i>, or <i>farthings</i>; but that prince coined it without
indenture; in lieu of which he first struck round half-pence and
farthings.</p>

<p class='c016'>By the term <b><span class='fss'>MEDAL</span></b>, we understand a piece of metal, in the form of a
coin, destined to preserve to posterity the portrait of some great
man, or the memory of some illustrious
<span class='pageno' title='416' id='Page_416'></span>action. They are distinguished by their different sizes; those of the larger
size, or volume, are called <i>medallions</i>. <i>Medallets</i> is a name given
by Pinkerton to those small pieces, or <i>missilia</i>, scattered among the
people on solemn occasions; those struck for the slaves in the
Saturnalia, private counters for gaming, tickets for baths and feasts,
tokens in copper and lead, and the like. Medallions were certainly
never intended to become current coin, as some medals probably were;
they were struck purely to serve as public monuments, or to be
presented by the emperor to his friends, and by the mint-makers to the
emperor, as specimens of fine workmanship. They were struck upon the
commencement of the reign of a new emperor, and other solemn
occasions; and frequently, especially the Greek medallions, as
monuments of gratitude, or of flattery. Sometimes they were trial or
pattern pieces, <i>testimonia probatæ monetæ</i>; and such abound after the
reign of Maximilian, with the “Tres monetæ” on the reverse. It is
observed, that all the Roman pieces in gold, exceeding the <i>denarius
aureus</i>; all in silver, superior to the <i>denarius</i>; and all in brass,
superior to the <i>sestertius</i>, or what the medallist terms large brass,
are comprehended under the description of medallions. Mr. Pinkerton,
however, thinks that the gold medallions, weighing two, three, or four
aurei only, passed in currency according to their size. Medallions
from the time of Julius to that of Adrian, are very uncommon, and of
very high price; from Adrian to the close of the western empire they
are, generally speaking, less rare. The types of the Roman medallions
are often repeated upon common coin; hence they appear of less
importance than the Greek; impressions of which are frequently most
uncommon, and nowhere else to be found. Many Roman medallions have
S.C., as being struck by order of the senate; those without these
initials, were struck by order of the emperor. Of Augustus, a noble
medallion was found in Herculaneum. There are medallions of Augustus
and Tiberius, struck in Spain; and one of Livia, at Patræ in Achaia.
One in brass, of Antony and Cleopatra; reverse, two figures in a car,
drawn by sea-horses. Of Tiberius there are many; and also of Claudius,
Agrippina, Nero, Galba, Vespasian, and Domitian, &amp;c. The Greek
medallions of Roman emperors are far more numerous than the Roman;
with a few exceptions, however, all medallions are rare and of
princely
<span class='pageno' title='417' id='Page_417'></span>purchase. Even in the richest cabinet, twenty or thirty specimens are esteemed a
respectable proportion.</p>

<p class='c016'>The parts of a medal are the two sides, one whereof is called the
<i>face</i>, <i>head</i>, or obverse; the other the <i>reverse</i>. On each side is
the <i>area</i>, or <i>field</i>; the <i>rim</i>, or <i>border</i>; and the <i>exergum</i>,
which is beneath the ground, whereon the figures represented are
placed. On the two sides are distinguished the <i>type</i>, and the
<i>inscription</i>, or <i>legend</i>. The type, or device, is the figure
represented; the legend is the writing, especially that around the
medal; though in the Greek medals the inscription is frequently on the
area. What we find in the exergum is, generally, no more than some
initial letters, whose meaning we are usually unacquainted with;
though, sometimes, they contain words that may be accounted an
inscription.</p>

<p class='c016'>The exergum sometimes contains the date of the coin, expressing in
what consulship of the emperor it was struck, as Cos. III. upon the
reverse of an Antoninus. Sometimes it signifies the place where it was
struck, and to which the coin properly belonged, as <b><span class='fss'>S. M. AL.</span></b> for
<i>Signata Moneta Alexandriœ</i>, upon the reverse of a Licinius.
Sometimes the name of a province, the reduction of which the medal is
designed to celebrate; as Judæa on the reverse of a Vespasian. Medals
usually have their figures in higher relief than coins.</p>

<p class='c016'>We have stated that medals are of great importance to the study of
history. They, indeed, furnish the principal proof of historic truth,
as their evidence reaches to the most remote ages, as well as to the
most remote countries. Vaillant, in his learned history of the Syrian
kings, printed at Paris, 1681, first fixed the dates, and arranged the
order of events in ancient historians, by means of these infallible
vouchers. Thus he was enabled to ascertain the chronology and progress
of events of three of the most important kingdoms of the ancient
world; viz. those of Egypt, of Syria, and of Parthia. The study of the
Roman medals has, in this respect, an advantage over that of Greek
coins, since they serve not only to illustrate the chronology of
reigns, but to aid us in the interpretation of particular events. To
this purpose, besides the portrait of the prince, and date of his
consulship, or of his tribunitian power, we have a representation, or
poetical symbol, of some grand event on the reverse. In a word, the
series of Roman coins presents
<span class='pageno' title='418' id='Page_418'></span>the very best suite of documents relating to the Roman History. In
addition to its historical importance, the medal is frequently a
useful guide to geography, natural history, architecture, ancient
monuments, busts, statues, ceremonies, and the like. See Addison’s
<i>Dialogues on the Usefulness of Ancient Medals</i>. On this subject,
also, Pinkerton, in his valuable work on medals, has some interesting
remarks; he says that, to a man of poetical imagination, the Roman
coins must prove an ample source of intellectual delight, by means of
the fine personifications and symbols which are to be found on their
reverse. <i>Happiness</i> has sometimes the caduceus, or wand of Mercury,
which Cicero tells us was thought to procure the gratification of
every wish. In a gold coin of Severus, she has heads of poppy to
express that our prime bliss lies in oblivion of misfortune. <i>Hope</i> is
represented as a sprightly damsel, walking quickly and looking
straightforward. With her left hand she holds up her garments, that
they may not hinder the rapidity of her pace; while, in her right
hand, she holds forth the bud of a flower, an emblem infinitely more
beautiful than the trite one of an anchor, which is the symbol of
Patience, not of Hope. <i>Abundance</i> is imaged as a sedate matron, with
a cornucopiæ in her hands, of which she scatters the fruits over the
ground: but does not hold it up, and keep its contents to herself, as
many poets and painters have represented her. <i>Security</i> stands
leaning on a pillar, indicative of her being free from all designs and
pursuits; and the posture itself corresponds to her name.</p>

<p class='c016'>Coins also present us with countries and rivers admirably personified.
On the reverse of a colonial coin, rude in execution, of Augustus and
Agrippa, inscribed <b><span class='fss'>IMP.</span></b> and <b><span class='fss'>DIVI. F.</span></b>, the conquest of Egypt is
represented by the apposite metaphor of the crocodile, an animal
almost peculiar to that country, and at that period esteemed
altogether so, which is chained to a palm tree, at once a native of
the country, and symbolic of victory. Moreover, a cabinet of medals,
of which Rubens is said to have possessed a very magnificent one, may
be considered as forming the classic erudition of a painter. We may
add, that almost all the uses which connect the science of medals with
painting, render it also subservient to the art of the sculptor, who
cannot less than profit by the study of the Greek coins in particular.
The connexion of the study of ancient coins
<span class='pageno' title='419' id='Page_419'></span>with architecture, consists in the views of many of the ancient edifices,
which are found in perfect preservation on medals. Froelich observes,
that the coins of Tarsus are very remarkable for a kind of perspective
in the figures. On others are found triumphal arches, temples,
fountains, aqueducts, amphitheatres, circuses, palaces, columns,
obelisks, baths, sea-ports, pharoses, and the like.</p>

<p class='c016'>The study of medals affords such a variety of amusement and of
instruction, that we may naturally suppose it to be nearly as ancient
as medals themselves; and yet ancient writers do not furnish us with a
single hint of collections of this kind. In the days of Greece, a
collection of such coins as then existed would not be regarded as an
acquisition of any great value, because it must have consisted only of
those that were struck by the innumerable little states which then
used the Greek characters and language, and of course it would be
considered as a kind of domestic coinage, precluded from extension by
the narrow limits of the intercourse that subsisted between different
provinces and countries. As soon as any communication was opened
between the Romans and the Greeks, the Grecian coins were imitated by
the Roman workmen, and preserved in the cabinets of their senators
among the choicest treasures. In a more advanced period of the Roman
empire, individuals must have formed collections of Roman coins; for
we find that a complete series of silver was lately found in our
island, containing inclusively all the emperors down to Carausius.
From the decline of the Roman empire, most branches of science were
enveloped in darkness, till the revival of letters towards the end of
the fifteenth century. When literature began to be cultivated in
Italy, the study of medals, connected with that of ancient erudition,
began to engage attention. Accordingly Petrarch, who in modern times
was amongst the first persons in Europe that aspired to the celebrity
of learning and genius, was likewise the first to revive the study of
medals. This eminent man, having been desired by the Emperor Charles
V. to compose a book that should contain a history of the coins of
illustrious men, and to place him in the list, is said to have
returned for answer, that he would comply with his desire, whenever
the Emperor’s future life and actions deserved it. Availing himself of
this circumstance, he sent that monarch a collection of gold and
silver coins of celebrated men.
<span class='pageno' title='420' id='Page_420'></span>“Behold!” said he, “to what men you have succeeded! Behold whom you should
imitate and admire! to whose very form and image you should compose
your talents! The invaluable present I should have given to no one but
yourself; it was due to you alone. I can only know or describe the
deeds of these great men: your supreme office enables you to imitate
them.” In the next age, Alphonso, king of Arragon, caused all the
ancient coins that could be discovered throughout the provinces of
Italy to be collected, which he placed in an ivory cabinet, and always
carried about with him, that he might be excited to great actions by
the presence, as it were, of so many illustrious men in their images.</p>

branch of antiquarian research, we strongly recommend Mr. Pinkerton’s
<i>Essay on Medals</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>Having been led to offer these observations on ancient medals, we may,
perhaps, be allowed to make one other digression on a subject
naturally suggested by a visit to the vicarage of our reverend
antiquary. The reader has been told, that “around his house he had
arranged several precious relics, amongst which was an ancient cross,
raised upon a platform on three steps.”</p>

<p class='c016'>There is much obscurity with regard to the origin and uses of these
stone crosses. We are, however, not disposed to enter into a
discussion of such difficulty; but the reader may be gratified in
having presented to him, in one view, a collection of such crosses as
still exist in various parts of Cornwall.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='421' id='Page_421'></span>Upon this subject, the reader is requested to turn to page 138, where
it is stated that a body will permanently rotate only on its shortest
axis. The philosophy of the fact is simply this--while a body revolves
on its axis, the component particles of its mass move in circles, the
centres of which are placed in the axis; a centrifugal force therefore
is generated, which is resisted by the cohesion of the parts of the
mass, and this tendency of each particle to fly off is expended in
exciting a pressure upon the axis; and it is this strain which
produces the effect in question, the axis of no pressure being alone
the permanent axis.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Vis Inertiæ</span>, p. 59.--The criticism of the vicar upon this subject is
scientifically judicious; but the literary reader who has justly
appreciated his character, may be inclined to ask how it could have
happened that he should have overlooked the classical authority by
which the expression is countenanced; we cannot answer the question,
but we will supply the deficiency. The connecting two ideas, which at
<span class='pageno' title='422' id='Page_422'></span>first sight appear opposed to each other, constituted a figure of speech
much used both by the Greeks and Romans. Euripides delighted in it,
which was a sufficient reason for Aristophanes to satirise it. Horace
has given us several examples of it, as “<i>Insaniens
sapientia</i>”--“<i>Strenua inertia</i>.”</p>

    <div><a id='note8' name='note8' />Note 8, p. <a href='#Page_62'>62</a>.--<span class='sc'>The mechanical powers</span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Mechanical powers are simple arrangements by which we gain power at
the expense of time; thus, if a certain weight can be raised to a
certain height by unassisted strength, and the same thing is
afterwards done with one tenth part of the exertion, through the use
of a mechanic power, it will be found to occupy ten times as much
time. In many cases, however, loss of time is not to be put in
competition with the ability to do a thing; and since the advantages
which the mechanical powers afford to man, by enabling him to perform
feats which, without their assistance, would have been for ever beyond
his reach, are incalculably great, the waste of time is overlooked,
and is much more than balanced in the general result. It is true, that
if there are several small weights, manageable by human strength, to
be raised to a certain height, it may be full as convenient to elevate
them one by one, as to take the advantage of the mechanical powers in
raising them all at once; because the same time will be necessary in
both cases: but suppose we should have an enormous block of stone, or
a great tree, to raise; bodies of this description cannot be separated
into parts proportionable to the human strength without immense
labour, nor, perhaps, without rendering them unfit for those purposes
to which they are to be applied; hence then the great importance of
the mechanical powers, by the use of which a man is able to manage
with ease a weight many times greater than himself.</p>

<p class='c016'>To understand the principle of a mechanical power, we must revert to
the doctrine of momentum. It will be remembered, that a small ball,
weighing only two pounds, and moving at the rate of 500 feet in a
second, will produce as much effect as a cannon ball of ten pounds in
weight, provided it only moved at the rate of 100 feet in the same
time; in like manner a ball weighing one pound may be made to balance
another of five pounds, by placing it five times farther from the
centre of motion; for in such a case,
<span class='pageno' title='423' id='Page_423'></span>for every inch of space through which the large ball passes, the small one
will traverse five inches, and will thus generate five times the
momentum. This may be rendered still more evident by turning to page
161, and note thereon, where the <i>see-saw</i> is described, which, in
fact, is a true mechanical power. It will be at once evident, from an
inspection of the figure, that the lesser boy will pass over a much
greater space, in equal time, than the greater boy, and thus generate
more momentum, which compensates for his defect in weight, and renders
him a balance for his heavier companion.--<i>See <a href='#note23'>note 23</a>.</i></p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Those who have been in the habit of inspecting the works of the
statuary, must frequently have detected the art which he has displayed
in imparting stability to his figures, by lowering their centre of
gravity. The bronze figure of Achilles, in Hyde Park, affords a very
striking illustration of such ingenuity; it is evident, from the
position and height of the figure, that, had not a mass of matter been
added to its base, its stability would have been extremely precarious,
since the slightest movement might have thrown its line of direction
beyond the base; but the addition at the base renders such an accident
impossible, by lowering its centre of gravity. Other examples of
similar contrivance are presented in several celebrated statues,
wherein stability is ensured by the judicious distribution of the
draperies. In the celebrated statue of Peter at St. Petersburgh, the
equilibrium of the mass is thus sustained by the introduction of a
serpent twining upwards to his horse’s tail. The effect, however, is
so unfortunate as to have given occasion for a wit to remark, “It is a
very fine horse, but what a pity that he should have worms!” Nor have
our celebrated painters overlooked a principle, the neglect of which
would have withheld from the most symmetrical figures the charms of
beautiful proportion.</p>

    <div><a id='note10' name='note10' />Note 10, p. <a href='#Page_93'>93</a>.--<span class='sc'>The Indian blow-pipe</span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“When a native of Macoushi goes in quest of feathered game, or other
birds, he seldom carries his bow and arrows. It is the <i>blow-pipe</i> he
then uses. This extraordinary tube of death is, perhaps, one of the
greatest natural curiosities
<span class='pageno' title='424' id='Page_424'></span>in Guiana. It is not found in the country of Macoushi. Those Indians tell
you that it grows to the south-west of them, in the wilds which extend
betwixt them and the Rio Negro. The reed must grow to an amazing
length, as the part the Indians use is from ten to eleven feet long,
and no tapering can be perceived in it, one end being as thick as the
other. It is of a bright yellow colour, perfectly smooth both inside
and out. It grows hollow; nor is there the least appearance of a knot
or joint throughout the whole extent. The natives call it <i>ourah</i>.
This, of itself, is too slender to answer the end of a blow-pipe; but
there is a species of palma, larger and stronger, and common in
Guiana, and this the Indians make use of as a case, in which they put
the <i>ourah</i>. It is brown, susceptible of a fine polish, and appears as
if it had joints five or six inches from each other. It is called
<i>samourah</i>, and the pulp inside is easily extracted, by steeping it
for a few days in water. Thus the ourah and samourah, one within the
other, form the blow-pipe of Guiana. The end which is applied to the
mouth is tied round with a small silk-grass cord, to prevent its
splitting; and the other end, which is apt to strike against the
ground, is secured by the seed of the acuero fruit, cut horizontally
through the middle, with a hole made in the end, through which is put
the extremity of the blow-pipe. It is fastened on with string on the
outside, and the inside is filled up with wild bees-wax. The arrow is
from nine to ten inches long. It is made out of the leaf of a species
of palm-tree, called <i>coucourite</i>, hard and brittle, and pointed as
sharp as a needle. About an inch of the pointed end is poisoned with
the <i>wourali</i>. The other end is burnt, to make it still harder, and
wild cotton is put round it for about an inch and a half. It requires
considerable practice to put on this cotton well. It must just be
large enough to fit the hollow of the tube, and taper off to nothing
downwards. They tie it on with a thread of the silk-grass to prevent
its slipping off the arrow.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The Indians have shown ingenuity in making a quiver to hold the
arrows. It will contain from five to six hundred...</p>

<p class='c016'>“...With a quiver of poisoned arrows slung over his shoulder, and with his
blow-pipe in his hand, in the same position as a soldier carries his
musket, see the Macoushi Indian advancing
<span class='pageno' title='425' id='Page_425'></span>towards the forest in quest of powises, maroudis, waracabas, and other
feathered game.</p>

<p class='c016'>“These generally sit high up in the tall and tufted trees, but still
are not out of the Indian’s reach; for this blow-pipe, at its greatest
elevation, will send an arrow 300 feet. Silent as midnight he steals
under them, and so cautiously does he tread the ground, that the
fallen leaves rustle not beneath his feet. His ears are open to the
least sound, while his eye, keen as that of the lynx, is employed in
finding out the game in the thickest shade. Often he imitates their
cry, and decoys them from tree to tree, till they are within range of
his tube. Then, taking a poisoned arrow from his quiver, he puts it in
the blow-pipe, and collects his breath for the fatal puff. About two
feet from the end through which he blows, there are fastened two teeth
of the acouri, and these serve him for a sight. Silent and swift the
arrow flies, and seldom fails to pierce the object at which it is
sent. Sometimes the wounded bird remains in the same tree where it was
shot, and in three minutes falls down at the Indian’s feet. Should he
take wing, his flight is of short duration; and the Indian, following
the direction he has gone, is sure to find him dead. It is natural to
imagine that, when a slight wound only is inflicted, the game will
make its escape. Far otherwise; the wourali poison almost
instantaneously mixes with blood or water, so that if you wet your
finger, and dash it along the poisoned arrow in the quickest manner
possible, you are sure to carry off some of the poison. Though three
minutes generally elapse before the convulsions come on in the wounded
bird, still a stupor evidently takes place sooner, and this stupor
manifests itself by an apparent unwillingness in the bird to move.” ...</p>

<p class='c016'>“The Indian, on his return home, carefully suspends his blow-pipe from
the top of his spiral roof; seldom placing it in an oblique position,
lest it should receive a cast.”--<span class='sc'>Waterton’s</span> <i>Wanderings in South
America</i>, p. 58.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>A clock is nothing more than a piece of machinery to maintain the
action of the pendulum, and at the same time to count and register the
number of its oscillations; and by that peculiar property, that one
vibration commences
<span class='pageno' title='426' id='Page_426'></span>exactly where the last terminates, no part of time is lost or gained in the
juxtaposition of the units so counted.</p>

<p class='c016'>If some extraneous force were not applied, in a clock or watch, to
maintain or perpetuate the natural vibrations of a pendulum, or
oscillations of a balance, they would soon come to rest, by reason of
friction in the mechanism, and the resistance opposed by the air to
the parts in motion. This force, in the larger clocks, is usually a
suspended weight; but, in the portable clock and watch, it is a spring
coiled in a metallic box, that actuates the wheel-work by gradually
unbending itself.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the former of these cases, the weight is suspended by a cord or
chain that is coiled round a cylinder when wound up, which cylinder
being of uniform diameter throughout its length, is acted on by the
cord, when fast at the interior end, by a similar force in every
situation; and, therefore, imparts through the train, connected with
its great wheel, invariable impulses to the escapement-wheel, at every
vibration of the pendulum; which pendulum receives therefrom such a
slight push, as is just sufficient to restore the momentum which it
loses from friction and the air’s resistance, and thus the uniform
motion of the pendulum is perpetuated. But when a spring is
substituted for a weight, it is clear that its agency cannot be
uniform, since, as the reader will learn by turning to page 101, it is
a general law that elastic bodies, in the recovery of their form,
after the removal of the compressing force, exert a greater power at
first than at last, so that the whole progress of restoration is a
<i>retarded</i> motion. It, therefore, became necessary to introduce some
mechanical contrivance which might equalize such motion. This
correction is effected by an apparatus termed a <b><span class='fss'>FUSEE</span></b>, and is nothing
more than the application of the wheel and axle; it is that conical
barrel seen in most watches round which the chain coils in the act of
winding up. When the fusee is full of chain, or the watch is wound up,
the spring, through the medium of the chain, will act upon its upper
part, which being very near the centre will give the spring but little
power; but, as the spring uncoils and diminishes in strength, it will
act upon a larger part of the fusee, until at last it gets to the
bottom of it, and consequently, if the several increasing grooves upon
it are made to increase in the same proportion as the power of the
spring decreases, an equable force must be obtained.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='427' id='Page_427'></span>Springs may be thus said to afford the means of <i>packing up</i> force, to
be used whenever it is required. Mr. Babbage observes that the half
minute which we daily devote to the winding up our watches is an
exertion by which we <i>pack</i> a quantity of force, which is gradually
expended during the ensuing twenty-four hours. Springs then will
enable us to avail ourselves of inconstant and variable forces which
must otherwise remain incapable of useful application, and the period
may arrive when force will thus become an article of traffic, and
machines be sent to the windmill to be wound up. The manner in which
force is constantly allowed to run to waste is quite extraordinary in
the present advanced state of science. We need only look at the
working of the treadmill. The public are little aware of the enormous
sums annually expended in towing vessels by steam from the Nore to the
port of London; were floating treadmills established, the labour of
those, upon whom punishment has been awarded, might be rendered
available to the most important interests; whereas, with the present
system, not only is this labour entirely lost, but is actually a
source of expense, for machines, with all the accompaniments of
engineers, are provided to counterbalance the force so uselessly
generated.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The elastic property of iron springs has been lately exemplified in a
very striking manner, by the invention of Pratt’s elastic chairs and
beds; which, instead of the usual stuffing of feathers, are filled
with iron wire!!! which is twisted into spiral form. Down itself
cannot be more gentle or springy; it yields to pressure, and yet never
becomes lumpy: beds thus constructed have the advantage of not heating
the body; and, above all, they never require to be shaken or “made.”
Had Vulcan fortunately made such a discovery before his ejectment from
Olympus, his wife, Venus, would surely never have treated him with
that contempt which mythologists have recorded of her; while her
priestesses, the housemaids, must, in gratitude, have been bound to
extend their protection to a benefactor, who could save them so much
daily labour. For particulars of this curious invention, the reader
may consult the <i>Literary Gazette</i> for March 17, 1827.</p>

</div>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='428' id='Page_428'></span>The phenomenon has been explained as depending upon the inertia of the
parts of matter, which renders a certain time necessary in order to
communicate to any body a sensible motion; so that when a body, moving
with considerable velocity, meets with another of much greater size,
it experiences almost as much resistance as if the latter were fixed.
Nothing is easier to be divided than water; yet, if the palm of the
hand be struck with some velocity against its surface, a considerable
degree of resistance, and even of pain, is experienced from it, as if
a solid body had been struck; nay, a musket ball, when fired against
water, is repelled and even flattened by it. In like manner, if we
load a musket with powder, and, instead of a ball, introduce a candle,
and fire it against a board, the latter will be pierced by the candle
end, as if by a ball. The cause of this phenomenon, no doubt, is, that
the rapid motion with which the candle end is impelled, does not allow
it time to be flattened, and therefore it acts as a hard body.</p>

<p class='c016'>Soils consist of a mixture of different finely divided earthy matter,
with animal or vegetable substances in a state of decomposition. In
order, therefore, to form a just idea of their nature, it is necessary
to conceive different rocks decomposed, or ground into parts and
powder of different degrees of fineness; some of their soluble parts
dissolved by water, and that water adhering to the mass, and the whole
mixed with larger or smaller quantities of the remains of vegetables
and animals, in different stages of decay. Hence it will follow, that
certain rocks will give origin to particular soils; thus poor and
hungry soils, such as are produced from the decomposition of granite
and sandstone, remain very often for ages with only a thin covering of
vegetation; while soils from the decomposition of limestone, chalk,
and basalt, are often clothed by nature with the perennial grasses;
and afford, when ploughed up, a rich bed of vegetation for every
species of cultivated
<span class='pageno' title='430' id='Page_430'></span>plant. In adverting to this subject, Dr. Buckland, in his inaugural lecture,
very justly observes, that it furnishes an instance of relation
between the vegetable and mineral kingdoms, and of the adaptation of
one to the other, which always implies design in the surest manner;
for had not the surface of the earth been thus prepared for their
reception, where would have been the use of all that admirable system
of organization bestowed upon vegetables? And it is no small proof of
design in the arrangement of the materials that compose the surface of
our earth, that whereas the primitive and granitic rocks are least
calculated to afford a fertile soil, they are for the most part made
to constitute the mountain districts of the world, which, from their
elevation and irregularities, would otherwise be but ill adapted for
human habitation; whilst the lower and more temperate regions are
usually composed of derivative or secondary strata, in which the
compound nature of their ingredients qualifies them to be of the
greatest utility to mankind by their subserviency to the purposes of
luxuriant vegetation.</p>

<p class='c016'>No doubt, then, can exist as to the important connexion between the
geological structure of a country, and its degree of fertility; but
the subject has not received the attention which it merits. And in the
hope that this note may meet the eye of some zealous geologist, the
author suggests the importance of commencing the enquiry in a
primitive district; for, as we advance from a primitive to an alluvial
district, the relations to which we have alluded become gradually less
distinct and apparent, and are ultimately lost in the confused
complication of the soil itself, and in that general obscurity which
necessarily envelopes every object in a state of decomposition: we
can, therefore, only hope to succeed in such an investigation, by a
patient and laborious examination of a primitive country, after which
we may be enabled to extend our enquiries with advantage through those
districts which are more completely covered with soil, and obscured by
luxuriant vegetation; as the eye, gazing upon a beautiful statue,
traces the outline of the limbs, and the swelling contour of its form,
through the flowing draperies which invest it.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The geological researches of Dr. Buckland have been long directed by a
desire to accumulate facts to prove that
<span class='pageno' title='431' id='Page_431'></span>there must have been an universal inundation of the earth; and, in his
inaugural lecture, he has presented us with a summary of such facts,
which, to use his own expression, whether considered collectively or
separately, present such a conformity of proofs, tending to establish
the universality of a recent inundation of the earth, as no
difficulties or objections that have hitherto arisen are in any way
sufficient to overrule.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the year 1822, Dr. Buckland read a memoir before the Royal Society,
announcing the discovery of a singular cave at Kirkdale in Yorkshire,
containing an assemblage of fossil teeth and bones of the elephant,
rhinoceros, hippopotamus, bear, tiger, and hyæna, and sixteen other
animals; with a comparative view of five similar caverns in various
parts of England, and others on the continent. For this important
paper the society awarded to its author their Copley medal; and it
constitutes the basis of a later and much more extended work, entitled
“<span class='sc'>Reliquiæ Diluvianæ</span>; or Observations on the Organic Remains contained
in Caves, Fissures, and Diluvial Gravel; and on other Geological
Phenomena, attesting the Action of an Universal Deluge. By the Rev. <span class='sc'>W.
Buckland</span>, B.D. F.R.S. &amp;c.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Let us explore the interior of this cavern. It was not till the summer
of 1821, that the existence of any animal remains, or of the cavern
containing them, was suspected. At this time, in continuing the
operations of a large quarry, the workmen accidentally intersected the
mouth of a long hole, closed externally with rubbish, and overgrown
with grass and bushes. As this rubbish was removed before any
competent person had examined it, it is not certain whether it was
composed of diluvial gravel and rolled pebbles, or was simply the
debris that had fallen from the softer portions of the strata that lay
above it: the workman, however, who removed it, and some gentlemen who
saw it, assured Dr. Buckland that it was composed of gravel and sand.
In the interior of the cavern, our indefatigable geologist could not
find a single rolled pebble, nor has he ever seen one bone, or
fragment of bone, that bore the slightest mark of having been rolled
by the action of water.</p>

<p class='c016'>The original entrance is said to have been very small, and, having
been filled up as above described, there could not have been any
admission of external air through it to the interior of the cavern.
Nearly 30 feet of its outer extremity
<span class='pageno' title='432' id='Page_432'></span>have now been removed, and the present entrance is a hole in the
perpendicular face of the quarry, about three feet high and five feet
broad, which it is only possible for a man to enter on his hands and
knees, and which expands and contracts itself irregularly from two to
seven feet in breadth, and two to fourteen feet in height. It is
unnecessary to enter into farther details; the reader, if he wishes
more minute information, may consult Dr. Buckland’s work.</p>

<p class='c016'>On entering the cave, the first thing observed was a sediment of soft
mud or loam, covering entirely its whole bottom to the average depth
of about a foot, and concealing the subjacent rock, or actual floor of
the cavern. Not a particle of mud was found attached either to the
sides or roof; nor was there a trace of it adhering to the sides or
upper portions of the transverse fissures, or any thing to suggest the
idea that it had entered through them. The mud was covered by a
<i>stalagmitic</i> crust, which had been formed by the dripping of water
impregnated with calcareous matter, as is common in all the cavities
of limestone; but it is important to remark, that there was not any
alternation of mud with any repeated beds of <i>stalagmite</i>, but simply
a partial deposit of the latter on the floor beneath; so that the mud
was encased, like meat in a pie, with an upper and under crust. It was
chiefly in the lower part of the earthy sediment, and in the
calcareous matter beneath it, that the animal remains were found.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the whole extent of the cave, only a very few large bones have been
discovered that are tolerably perfect; most of them are broken into
small angular fragments and chips, the greater part of which lay
separately in the mud, whilst others were wholly or partially invested
with stalagmite, and others again mixed with masses of still smaller
fragments. In some few places, where the mud was shallow, and the
heaps of teeth and bones considerable, parts of the latter were
elevated some inches above the surface of the mud and its calcareous
crust; and the upper ends of the bones thus projecting, like the legs
of pigeons through a pie crust, into the void space above, have become
thinly covered with calcareous drippings, whilst their lower
extremities have no such incrustation, and have simply adhering to
them the mud in which they have been imbedded.</p>

<p class='c016'>The effect of the loam and stalagmite in preserving the
<span class='pageno' title='433' id='Page_433'></span>bones from decomposition, by protecting them from all access of atmospheric
air, has been very remarkable.</p>

<p class='c016'>The workmen, in first discovering the bones at Kirkdale, supposed them
to have belonged to cattle that died by a murrain in this district a
few years ago, and they were for some time neglected, and thrown on
the roads with the common limestone; they were, at length, noticed by
Mr. Harrison, a medical gentleman in the neighbourhood, and have since
been collected and deposited in various private and public museums.
The teeth and bones which have been discovered in this cave appear to
have belonged to the <i>hyæna, tiger, bear, wolf, fox,
weasel, elephant, rhinoceros, hippopotamus, horse, ox,
deer, hare, rabbit, water-rat, mouse, raven, pigeon,
lark, snipe</i>, and a small species of <i>duck</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>The bottom of the cave, on first removing the mud, was found to be
strewed all over like a dog-kennel, from one end to the other, with
hundreds of teeth and bones, or rather broken and splintered fragments
of bones, of all the animals above enumerated; scarcely a single bone
has escaped fracture, with the exception of some of the more solid and
hard bones of the foot; on some of these bones marks may be traced,
which, on applying one to the other, appear exactly to fit the form of
the canine teeth of the hyæna that occur in the cave. The hyæna’s
bones have been broken, and apparently gnawed equally with those of
the other animals. Heaps of small splinters, and highly comminuted,
yet angular fragments of bone, mixed with teeth of all the varieties
of animals above enumerated, lay in the bottom of the den,
occasionally adhering together by calcareous cement. Not one skull is
to be found entire; and it is so rare to find a large bone of any kind
that has not been more or less broken, that there is no hope of
obtaining materials for the construction of a single limb, and still
less of an entire skeleton. The jaw-bones, also, even of the hyænas,
are broken to pieces like the rest.</p>

<p class='c016'>It must already appear probable, from the facts above described,
particularly from the comminuted and gnawed condition of the bones,
that the cave at Kirkdale was, during a long succession of years,
inhabited as a den by hyænas, and that they dragged into its recesses
the other animals, whose remains are found indiscriminately mixed with
their own: an hypothesis which is certainly strengthened by Dr.
Buckland having found the excrement of the
<span class='pageno' title='434' id='Page_434'></span>animal in the same cave. Should it be asked why we do not find, at least, the
entire skeleton of the one or more hyænas that died last, and left no
survivors to devour them; we find a sufficient reply to this question,
in the circumstance of the probable destruction of the last
individuals by the waters of the deluge. On the rise of these, had
there been any hyænas in the den, they would have rushed out, and fled
for safety to the hills; and if absent, they could not by any
possibility have returned to it from the higher levels; that they were
extirpated by the catastrophe is obvious, from the discovery of their
bones in the diluvial gravel both of England and Germany.</p>

<p class='c016'>The accumulation of these bones, then, appears to have been a process
of years, whilst all the animals in question were natives of this
country. The general dispersion of bones of the same animals through
the diluvial gravel of high latitudes, over a great part of the
northern hemisphere, shows that the period in which they inhabited
these regions was that immediately preceding the formation of this
gravel, and that they perished by the same waters which produced it.
M. Cuvier has, moreover, ascertained that the fossil elephant,
rhinoceros, hippopotamus, and hyæna, belong to species now unknown;
and as there is no evidence that they have at any time, subsequent to
the formation of the diluvium, existed in these regions, we may
conclude that the period at which the bones of these extinct species
were introduced into the cave at Kirkdale was before the deluge.</p>

<p class='c016'>Thus the phenomena of this cave seem referable to a period immediately
antecedent to the general deluge, and in which the world was inhabited
by land animals, almost all bearing a generic, and many a specific
resemblance to those which now exist; but so completely has the
violence of that tremendous convulsion destroyed and remodelled the
form of the antediluvian surface, that it is only in caverns that have
been protected from its ravages, that we may hope to find undisturbed
evidence of events in the period immediately preceding it. The bones
already described, and the calcareous matter formed before the
introduction of the diluvial mud, are what Dr. Buckland considers to
be the products of the period in question. It was indeed probable,
before the discovery of this cave, from the abundance in which the
remains of similar species
<span class='pageno' title='435' id='Page_435'></span>occur in superficial gravel beds, which cannot be referred to any other than
a diluvial origin, that such animals were the antediluvian inhabitants
not only of this country, but generally of all those northern
latitudes in which their remains are found, (but the proof was
imperfect, as it was possible they might have been drifted or floated
hither by the waters from the warmer regions of the earth,) but the
facts developed in this charnel-house of the antediluvian forests of
Yorkshire demonstrate that there was a long succession of years, in
which the elephant, rhinoceros, and hippopotamus had been the prey of
the hyænas, which, like themselves, inhabited England in the period
immediately preceding the formation of the diluvial gravel. Having
thus far described the principal facts to be observed in the interior
of this cave, Dr. Buckland proceeds to point out the chronological
inferences that may be derived from the state of the bones, and of the
mud and stalagmite that accompany them, and to extract the following
detail of events that have been going on successively within this
curious cave:--</p>

<p class='c016'>First, There appears to have been a period (and, if we may form an
estimate from the small quantity of stalagmite now found on the actual
floor of the cave, a very short one,) during which this aperture in
the rock existed in its present state, but was not tenanted by the
hyænas.</p>

<p class='c016'>The second period was that during which the cave was inhabited by the
hyænas, and the stalactite and stalagmite were still forming.</p>

<p class='c016'>The third period is that at which the mud was introduced and the
animals extirpated, viz. the period of the deluge. It has been already
stated, that there is not any alternation of this mud with beds of
bone or of stalagmite, such as would have occurred had it been
produced by land floods often repeated; <i>once</i>, <i>and once only</i>, it
appears to have been introduced; and we may consider its vehicle to
have been the turbid waters of the same inundation that produced
universally the diluvial gravel.</p>

<p class='c016'>The fourth period is that during which the stalagmite was deposited
which invests the upper surface of the mud.</p>

<p class='c016'>In concluding this note, we take the opportunity of recommending all
those who feel interested in the researches of geology, to read a work
lately published, entitled “<span class='sc'>The Wonders of Geology</span>, by Gideon Mantell,
LL.D. F.R.S. &amp;c.”</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='436' id='Page_436'></span>Rifle guns are those whose barrels, instead of being smooth on the
inside, like our common pieces, are formed with a number of spiral
channels, resembling screws; except only that the threads, or rifles,
are less deflected, making only one turn, or a little more, in the
whole length of the piece. This construction is employed for
correcting the irregularity in the flight of balls from smooth
barrels, by imparting to the balls a rotatory motion perpendicular to
the line of direction. The same effect has lately been accomplished by
an extremely simple and obvious contrivance, and which will, probably,
altogether supersede the necessity of rifling the barrel. It consists
in cutting a spiral groove in the bullet itself, which, when
discharged, is thus acted upon by the air, and the same rotatory
motion imparted to it as that produced by the furrows in the barrel.
But it is the rotatory motion which steadies the flight of the ball;
and by whichever method this is produced, the theory of its action
will be the same. It has been long and generally known, that when the
common bullet is discharged from a plane barrel, its flight is
extremely irregular and uncertain; it has, for instance, been found,
from the experiments of Mr. Robins, that, notwithstanding the piece
was firmly fixed, and fired with the same weight of powder, the ball
was sometimes deflected to the right, sometimes to the left, sometimes
above, and at others below the true line of direction. It has also
been observed, that the degree of deflection increases in a much
greater proportion than the distance of the object fired at. It is not
difficult to account for these irregularities; they, doubtless,
proceed from the impossibility of fitting a ball so accurately to any
plane piece, but that it will rub more against one side of the barrel
than another in its passage through it. Whatever side, therefore, of
the muzzle, the ball is last in contact with, on quitting the piece,
it will acquire a whirling motion towards that side, and will be found
to bend the line of its flight in the same direction, whether it be
upwards or downwards, to the right or left; or obliquely, partaking in
some degree of both; and, after quitting the barrel, this deflection,
though in the first instance but trifling and inconsiderable, is still
farther increased by the resistance of the air;
<span class='pageno' title='437' id='Page_437'></span>this being greatest on that side where the whirling motion conspires with
the progressive one, and least on that side where it is opposed to it.
Thus, if the ball, in its passage out, rubs against the left side of
the barrel, it will whirl towards that side; and as the right side of
the ball will, therefore, turn up against the air during its flight,
the resistance of the air will become greatest on the right side, and
the ball be forced away to the left, which was the direction it
whirled in. It happens, moreover, from various accidental
circumstances, that the axis of the ball’s rotation frequently changes
its position several times during the flight; so that the ball,
instead of bending its course uniformly in the same direction, often
describes a track variously contorted. From this view of the causes of
aberration in the flight of balls, it will be evident that the only
means of correcting it is by preventing the ball from rubbing more
against one side of the barrel than another in passing through it; and
by giving to the bullet a motion which will counteract every
accidental one, and preserve its direction, by making the resistance
of the air upon the forepart continue the same during its whole
flight; that is, by giving it a rotatory motion perpendicular to the
line of direction. The contrivance for this purpose is called
<i>rifling</i>, and consists, as we have before stated, in forming upon the
inside of the barrel a number of threads and furrows, either in a
straight or spiral direction, into which the ball is moulded; and
hence, when the gun is fired, the indented zone of the bullet follows
the sweep of the rifle, and thereby, besides its progressive motion,
acquires a considerable one round the axis of the barrel, which motion
will be continued to the bullet after its separation from the piece,
so that it is constantly made to whirl round an axis coincident with
the line of its flight. Many familiar examples of the utility and
effect of <i>rifling</i> might be here adduced. If the bricklayer, while
unroofing a house, be observed, he will be seen to give to the slates
which he throws down a whirling motion, at a certain angle, which
ensures their falling edgeways on the ground, and thus preserves them
from fracture.</p>

<p class='c016'>In relation to the subject in the text, to which this note refers, may
be introduced a notice of the “<span class='sc'>Bommereng</span>,” a missile used by the
natives of Australia, and thus described by Major Mitchell in his
“<i>Journal of an expedition to the
<span class='pageno' title='438' id='Page_438'></span>Rivers Darling and Murray.</i>” “The bommereng, a thin, curved missile, about
two feet four inches long, can be thrown by a skilful hand so as to
rise upon the wind with a rotatory motion, and in a crooked direction
towards any given point with great precision, and to return, after a
considerable flight, to within a yard or two of the thrower; or, by
striking the ground near him, to bound so as to hit at a great,
distance, “<i>en ricochet</i>” any object behind a tree. This singular
weapon probably originated in the utility of such a missile for the
purpose of killing ducks, where they are very numerous, as on the
interior rivers and lagoons, and where we accordingly find it much
more in use than on the sea coast, and better made, being often
covered with good carving.” This instrument may now be purchased in
most of the London toy-shops.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>It has been stated in the text, that the gyrations of the top depend
exactly upon the same principle as that which produces the <i>precession
of the equinoxes</i>; viz. an unequal attractive force exerted upon the
revolving mass. In the one case, this is known to arise from the
action of the sun and moon on the excess of matter about the
equatorial regions of the earth; in the other, from the parts of the
top being unequally affected by gravity, while it is spinning in an
inclined or oblique position. To those philosophers who have
condescended to read the present work, if there be any such, and are
thereby induced to pursue the investigation of a subject which has
hitherto excited far too little attention, we beg to submit the
following remarks:--</p>

<p class='c016'>If a top could be made to revolve on a point without friction, and in
a vacuum, in the case of its velocity being
<span class='pageno' title='439' id='Page_439'></span><i>infinite</i>, it would continue to revolve for ever, in the same position, without
gyration. If the velocity were <i>finite</i>, it would for ever remain
unchanged in position, in the event of the centre of gravity being
directly over the point of rotation. In any other position (supposing
its velocity very great, although not infinite) there would arise a
continued uniform gyration; the line which passes through the point of
rotation, and the centre of gravity, always making the same angle with
the horizon, or describing the same circle round the zenith. But in
all artificial experiments the circumstances are very remarkably
changed; if, indeed, the centre of gravity happens to be situated
perpendicularly over the point of rotation, the top will continue
quite steady, or <i>sleeping</i>, as it is termed, till nearly the whole of
its velocity of rotation is expended. In any other position the top
begins to gyrate, but reclining at all times on the outside of its
physical point of gyration, the top is uniformly impelled inwards; and
this (when the velocity is considerable, and the point broad) acts
with a force sufficient for carrying the top towards its quiescent or
<i>sleeping</i> point; but when the velocity is much diminished, this power
becomes feeble, the gyrations increase in diameter, and the top
ultimately falls.</p>

    <div><a id='note23' name='note23' />Note 23, p. <a href='#Page_161'>161</a>.--<span class='sc'>The mechanical powers</span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The mechanical powers are all founded upon the principle that <i>the
lengths of circles are in proportion to their diameters</i>; for it is an
immediate consequence of this property of the circle, that if a rod of
iron, or beam of wood, be placed on a point or pivot, so that it may
move round its prop, the two ends will go through parts of circles,
each proportioned to that arm of the beam to which it belongs; the two
circles will be equal if the pivot is in the centre or middle point of
the beam; but if it is nearer one end than the other, say five times,
that end will pass through a circular space, or <i>arc</i>, five times
shorter than the circular space the other end goes through in the same
time. If, then, the end of the long beam goes through five times the
space, it must move with five times the swiftness of the short end,
since both move in the same time; and, therefore, any force applied to
the long end must overcome the resistance of five times that force
applied at the opposite end, since the two ends move in contrary
directions; hence
<span class='pageno' title='440' id='Page_440'></span>one pound placed at the long end would balance five placed at the short
end.</p>

<p class='c016'>The beam we have been describing constitutes the first of the
mechanical powers, and is termed the <b><span class='fss'>LEVER</span></b>. There are, besides, five
others, viz. the <i>wheel and axle</i>; the <i>inclined plane</i>; the <i>screw</i>;
the <i>pulley</i>; and the <i>wedge</i>; out of the whole, or a part of which,
it will be found that every mechanical engine or piece of machinery is
constructed.</p>

<p class='c016'><b><span class='sc'>The Lever</span></b> being the simplest of all the mechanic powers, is in general
considered the first. It is an inflexible rod or bar of any kind, so
disposed as to turn on a pivot or prop, which is always called its
<i>fulcrum</i>. It has the weight or resistance to be overcome attached to
some one part of its length, and the power which is to overcome that
resistance applied to another; and, since the <i>power</i>, <i>resistance</i>,
and <i>fulcrum</i> admit of various positions with regard to each other, so
is the lever divided into three kinds or modifications, distinguished
as the first, second, and third kinds of lever. That portion of it
which is contained between the fulcrum and the power, is called the
acting part or arm of the lever; and that part which is between the
fulcrum and resistance, its resisting part or arm.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the lever of the first kind, the fulcrum is placed between the
power and the resistance. A poker, in the act of stirring the fire,
well illustrates this subject; the bar is the <i>fulcrum</i>, the hand the
power, and the coals the resistance to be overcome. Another common
application of this kind of lever is the crow-bar, or hand-spike, used
for raising a large stone or weight. In all these cases power is
gained in proportion as the distance from the fulcrum to the power, or
part where the men apply their strength, is greater than the distance
from the fulcrum to that end under the stone or weight. A moment’s
reflection will show the rationale of this fact; for it is evident
that if both the arms of the lever be equal, that is to say, if the
fulcrum be midway between the power and weight, no advantage can be
gained by it, because they pass over equal spaces in the same time;
and, according to the fundamental principle already laid down, <i>as
advantage or power is gained, time must be lost</i>; but, since no time
is lost under such circumstances, there cannot be any power gained.
If, now, we suppose the fulcrum to be so removed towards the weight,
as to make the acting arm of the lever three times the length of the
resisting
<span class='pageno' title='441' id='Page_441'></span>arm, we shall obtain a lever which gains power in the proportion of three
to one, that is, a single pound weight applied at the upper end will
balance three pounds suspended at the other. A pair of scissors
consists of two levers of this kind, united in one common fulcrum;
thus the point at which the two levers are screwed together is the
fulcrum; the handles to which the power of the fingers is applied, are
the extremities of the acting part of the levers, and the cutting part
of the scissors are the resisting parts of the levers; the longer,
therefore, the handles, and the shorter the points of the scissors,
the more easily you cut with them. A person who has any hard substance
to cut, without any knowledge of the theory, diminishes as much as
possible the length of the resisting arms, or cutting part of the
scissors, by making use of that part of the instrument nearest the
screw or rivet. Snuffers are levers of a similar description; so are
most kind of pincers, the power of which consists in the resisting arm
being very short in comparison with the acting one.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the lever of the second kind, the resistance or weight is between
the fulcrum and the power. Numberless instances of its application
daily present themselves to our notice; amongst which may be
enumerated the common cutting knife, used by last and patten makers,
one end of which is fixed to the work-bench by a swivel-hook. Two men
carrying a load between them, by one or more poles, as a sedan chair,
or as brewers carrying a cask of beer, in which case either the back
or front man may be considered as the fulcrum, and the other as the
power. Every door which turns upon its hinges is a lever of this kind;
the hinges may be considered as the fulcrum, or centre of motion; the
whole door is the weight to be moved, and the power is applied to that
side on which the handle is usually fixed. Nut-crackers, oars, rudders
of ships, likewise fall under the same division. The boat is the
weight to be moved, the water is the fulcrum, and the waterman at the
oar is the power. The masts of ships are also levers of the second
kind, for the bottom of the vessel is the fulcrum, the ship the
weight, and the wind acting against the sail is the moving power. In
this kind of lever the power or advantage is gained in proportion as
the distance of the power is greater than the distance of the weight
from the fulcrum; if, for instance, the weight hang at one inch from
<span class='pageno' title='442' id='Page_442'></span>the fulcrum, and the power acts at five inches from it, the power gained
is five to one; because, in such a case, the power passes over five
times as great a space as the weight. It is thus evident why there is
considerable difficulty in pushing open a heavy door, if the hand is
applied to the part next the hinges, although it may be opened with
the greatest ease in the usual method. In the third kind of lever, the
fulcrum is again at one of the extremities, the weight or resistance
at the other; and it is now the power which is applied between the
fulcrum and resistance. As in this case the weight is farther from the
centre of motion than the power, such a lever is never used, except in
cases of absolute necessity, as in the case of lifting up a ladder
perpendicularly, in order to place it against a wall. The man who
raises it cannot place his hands on the upper part of the ladder; the
power, therefore, is necessarily placed much nearer the fulcrum than
the weight; for the hands are the power, the ground the fulcrum, and
the upper part of the ladder the weight. The use of the common
fire-tongs is another example, but the circumstance that principally
gives this lever importance is, that the limbs of men and animals are
actuated by it; for the bones are the levers, while the joints are the
fulcra, and the muscles which give motion to the limbs, or produce the
power, are inserted and act close to the joints, while the action is
produced at the extremities; the consequence of such an arrangement
is, that although the muscles must necessarily exert an enormous
contractile force to produce great action at the extremities, yet a
celerity of motion ensues which could not be equally well provided for
in any other manner. We may adduce one example in illustration of this
fact. In lifting a weight with the hand, the lower part of the arm
becomes a lever of the third kind; the elbow is the fulcrum; the
muscles of the fleshy part of the arm the power; and as these are
nearer to the elbow than the hand, it is necessary that their power
should exceed the weight to be raised. The disadvantage, however, with
respect to power, is more than compensated by the convenience
resulting from this structure of the arm; and it is no doubt that
which is best adapted to enable it to perform its various functions.
From these observations it must appear, that although this arrangement
must be mentioned as a modification of the lever, it cannot, in
strictness, be called a mechanical power;
<span class='pageno' title='443' id='Page_443'></span>since its resisting arm is in all cases, except one, longer than the
acting arm, and in that one case is equal to it, on which account it
never can gain power, but in most instances must lose it.</p>

<p class='c016'><b><span class='sc'>The Wheel and Axle</span></b> is the next mechanical power to be considered; it
must be well known to every reader who has seen a village well; for it
is by this power that the bucket is drawn up, although in such cases,
instead of a wheel attached to the axle, there is generally only a
crooked handle, which answers the purpose of winding the rope round
the axle, and thus raising the bucket, as may be seen in the engraving
at the head of our third chapter. It is evident, however, that this
crooked handle is equivalent to a wheel; for the handle describes a
circle as it revolves, while the straight piece which is united to the
axle corresponds with the spoke of a wheel. This power may be resolved
into a lever; in fact, what is it but a lever moving round an axle?
and always retaining the effect gained during every part of the
motion, by means of a rope wound round the butt end of the axle; the
spoke of the wheel being the long arm of the lever, and the half
diameter of the axle its short arm. The axle is not in itself a
mechanical power, for it is as impotent as a lever whose fulcrum is in
the centre; but add to it the wheel, and we have a power which will
increase in proportion as the circumference of the wheel exceeds that
of the axle. This arises from the velocity of the circumference being
so much greater than that of the axle, as it is farther from the
centre of motion; for the wheel describes a great circle in the same
space of time that the axle describes a small one; therefore the power
is increased in the same proportion as the circumference of the wheel
is greater than that of the axle. Those who have ever drawn a bucket
from a well by this machine, must have observed, that as the bucket
ascended nearer the top the difficulty increased: such an effect must
necessarily follow from the views we have just offered; for whenever
the rope coils more than once the length of the axle, the difference
between its circumference and that of the wheel is necessarily
diminished. To the principle of the wheel and axle may be referred the
capstan, windlass, and all those numerous kinds of cranes which are to
be seen at the different wharfs on the banks of the river Thames. It
is scarcely necessary to add that the force of the windmill
<span class='pageno' title='444' id='Page_444'></span>depends upon a similar power. The <i>treadmill</i> furnishes another
striking example. The wheel and axle is sometimes used to multiply
motion, instead of to gain power, as in the multiplying wheel of the
common jack, to which it is applied when the weight cannot
conveniently have a long line of descent; a heavy weight is in this
case made to act upon the axle, while the wheel, by its greatest
circumference, winds up a much longer quantity of line than the simple
descent of the weight could require, and thus the machine is made to
go much longer without winding than it otherwise would do.</p>

<p class='c016'><b><span class='sc'>The Pulley</span></b> is a power of very extensive application. Every one must
have seen a pulley; it is a circular and flat piece of wood or metal,
with a string which runs in a groove round it. Where, however, this is
fixed, it cannot afford any power to raise a weight; for it is evident
that, in order to raise it, the power must be greater than the weight,
and that if the rope be pulled down one inch, the weight will only
ascend the same space; consequently, there cannot be any mechanical
advantage from the arrangement. This, however, is not the case where
the pulley is not fixed. Suppose one end of the rope be fastened to a
hook in the ceiling, and that to the moveable pulley on the rope a
cask be attached, is it not evident that the hand applied to the other
extremity of the rope will sustain it more easily than if it held the
cask suspended to a cord without a pulley? Experience shows that this
is the fact, and theory explains it by suggesting that the fixed hook
sustains half the weight, and that the hand, therefore, has only the
other half to sustain. The hook will also afford the same assistance
in raising the weight as in sustaining it; if the hand has but one
half the weight to sustain, it will also have only one half the weight
to raise; but observe, says Mrs. Marcet, that in raising the weight,
the velocity of the hand must be double that of the cask; for, in
order to raise the weight one inch, the hand must draw each of the
strings one inch; the whole string is therefore shortened two inches,
while the weight is raised only one. Pulleys then act on the same
principle as the lever, the deficiency of strength of the power being
compensated by its superior velocity. It will follow, from these
premises, that the greater the number of pulleys connected by a
string, the more easily the weight is raised, as the difficulty
<span class='pageno' title='445' id='Page_445'></span>is divided amongst the number of strings, or rather of parts into which
the string is divided by the pulleys. Several pulleys, thus connected,
form what is called a system, or tackle of pulleys. They may have been
seen suspended from cranes, to raise goods into warehouses, and in
ships to draw up the sails.</p>

<p class='c016'><b><span class='sc'>The Inclined Plane</span></b> is a mechanic power which is seldom used in the
construction of machinery, but applies more particularly to the moving
or raising of loads upon slopes or hills, as in rolling a cask up or
down a sloping plank into or out of a cart or cellar, or drawing a
carriage up a sloping road or hill, all which operations are performed
with less exertion than would be required if the same load were lifted
perpendicularly. It is a power which cannot be resolved into that of
the lever: it is a distinct principle, and those writers who have
attempted to simplify the mechanical powers, have been obliged to
acknowledge the inclined plane is elementary. The method of estimating
the advantage gained by this mechanical power is very easy; for just
as much as the length of the plane exceeds its perpendicular height,
so much is the advantage gained; if, for instance, its length be three
times greater than its height, a weight could be drawn to its summit
with a third part of the strength required for lifting it up at the
end; but, in accordance with the principle so frequently alluded to,
such a power will be at the expense of time, for there will be three
times more space to pass over. The reason why horses are eased by
taking a zig-zag direction, in ascending or descending a steep hill,
will appear from the preceding account of the action of the inclined
plane, because in this way the effective length of the inclining
surface is increased while its height remains the same.</p>

<p class='c016'><b><span class='sc'>The Wedge</span></b> is rather a compound, than a distinct mechanical power;
since it is composed of two inclined planes, and in action frequently
performs the functions of a lever. It is sometimes employed in raising
bodies; thus the largest ship may be raised to a small height by
driving a wedge below it; but its more common application is that of
dividing and cleaving bodies. As an elevator, it resembles exactly the
inclined plane; for the action is obviously the very same, whether the
wedge be pushed under the load, or the load be drawn under [sic] the
wedge. But when the wedge is drawn forward, the percussive tremor
excited
<span class='pageno' title='446' id='Page_446'></span>destroys, for an instant, the adhesion or friction at its sides, and
augments prodigiously the effect. From this principle chiefly is
derived the power of the wedge in rending wood and other substances.
It then acts besides as a lever, insinuating itself into the cleft as
fast as the parts are opened by the vibrating concussion. To bring the
action of the wedge, therefore, under a strict calculation, would be
extremely difficult, if not impossible. Its effects are chiefly
discovered by experience. All the various kinds of cutting tools, such
as axes, knives, chisels, saws, planes, and files, are only different
modifications of the wedge.</p>

<p class='c016'><b><span class='sc'>The Screw</span></b> is a most efficient mechanic power, and is of great force
and general application. It is in reality nothing more than an
inclined plane formed round a cylinder, instead of being a continued
straight line. Its power is, therefore, estimated by taking its
circumference, and dividing this by the distance between any two of
its threads; for what is taking the circumference of a screw, but
another mode of measuring the length of the inclined plane which wraps
round it? and taking the distance between one thread and the next to
it, is but measuring the rise of that inclined plane in such length;
and from the properties of the inclined plane, it follows, that the
closer the threads of a screw are together in proportion to its
diameter, the greater will be the power gained by it.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>A <i>cycloid</i> is a peculiar curve line; and is described by any one
point of a circle as it rolls along a plane, and turns round its
centre; thus, for instance, the nail on the felly of a cart-wheel
traces a cycloid in the air as the wheel proceeds. This curve is
distinguished by some remarkable properties, the most important of
which is that mentioned in the text, viz. that any body moving in such
a curve, by its own weight, or swing, will pass through all distances
of it in exactly the same time; and it is for such a reason that
pendulums are made to swing in cycloids, in order that they may move
in equal times, whether they go through a long or a short part of the
same curve. Where the arc described is small, a portion of the circle
will be sufficiently accurate, because it will be seen that such an
arc will not deviate much from an equal portion of a cycloidal curve.</p>

<p class='c016'>The cycloid is remarkable as being that path, with the
<span class='pageno' title='447' id='Page_447'></span>exception of the perpendicular, through which a body will move with
the greatest velocity; suppose, for example, a body is to descend from
any one point to any other, by means of some force acting on it,
together with its weight: a person unacquainted with mechanics would
say at once, that a straight line is the path it must take to effect
this in the shortest possible time, since that is the shortest of all
lines that can be drawn between two points. Undoubtedly it is the
shortest; notwithstanding which, however, the body would be longer in
traversing it, than in moving through a cycloid. If a body were to
move through a space of fifty or a hundred yards, by its weight and
some other force acting together, the way it must take to do this in
the shortest possible time is by moving in a cycloid. It is supposed
that birds which build in the rocks possess an instinctive knowledge
of this fact, and drop or fly down from height to height in this
course. There is certainly a general resemblance between the curved
path they describe on such occasions, and the cycloid, but it would be
difficult to establish the fact by experiment. Man, however, has
founded upon this principle some applications of great value in
practical mechanics. In Switzerland, and in several parts of Germany,
for example, slides have been constructed along the sides of
mountains, by which the timber felled near their summits is conducted
with extreme rapidity to the distant valleys.</p>

<p class='c016'>This interesting game is of French origin (<i>billiard</i>, of <i>bile</i>, and
from the Latin, <i>pila</i>, a ball). It was hailed as a favourite
diversion at the court of Henry III. of France; and was thence
communicated to all the courts of modern Europe. To the novice it may
appear as a game of accidents and chances, but experience has enabled
us to determine the effects of the stroke given to a ball with
wonderful precision; and it is quite extraordinary to observe the
accuracy with which an accomplished player can effect his object, by
measuring with his eye the angle at which he should make the stroke,
the position of the ball with respect to the cushion, and the distance
of the point of the ball from its centre, at which it should be
struck. By such skilful management the ball may be made to take
directions which would, at first view, be regarded as contrary
<span class='pageno' title='448' id='Page_448'></span>to all the known laws of motion, such, for instance, as passing round an
object, such as a hat placed on the table, and to strike a ball behind
it into a pocket.</p>

celebrated billiard-table maker of Catherine Street, Strand. We

    <div><a id='note26' name='note26' />Note 26, p. <a href='#Page_172'>172</a>.--<span class='sc'>Collision of bodies</span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>In investigating the effects produced upon bodies by collision, it is
necessary to distinguish between elastic and non-elastic substances,
since their motions after impact are governed by very different laws.</p>

<p class='c016'>If two bodies, <i>void of elasticity</i>, move in one right line, either
the same or contrary ways, so that one body may strike directly
against another, let the <i>sum</i> of their motions before the stroke, if
they move the same way, and the <i>difference</i> of their motions, if
contrary ways, be divided into two such parts as are proportional to
the quantities of matter in the bodies, and each of those parts will
respectively exhibit the motion of each body after the stroke: for
example, if the quantities of matter in the bodies be as <i>two</i> to
<i>one</i>, and their motions before the stroke as <i>five</i> and <i>four</i>, then
the sum of their motions is <i>nine</i>, and the difference is <i>one</i>; and
therefore, when they move the same way, the motion of that body, which
is as <i>two</i>, will, after the stroke, be <i>six</i>, and the motion of the
other, <i>three</i>; but, if they move in contrary directions, the motion
of the greater body after the stroke will be <i>two-thirds of one</i>, and
of the lesser body <i>one-third of one</i>; for, since the bodies are void
of elasticity, they will not separate after the stroke, but move
together with one and the same velocity; and, consequently, their
motions will be proportional to their quantities of matter; and it
follows from the fact of action and reaction being equal, that no
motion is either lost or gained by the stroke when the bodies move the
same way; because, whatever motion one body imparts to the other, so
much must it lose of its own; and, consequently, the <i>sum</i> of their
motions before the stroke is neither increased nor diminished by the
stroke, but is so divided between the bodies, as that they may move
together with one common velocity; that is, it is divided between the
bodies in proportion to
<span class='pageno' title='449' id='Page_449'></span>their quantities of matter: but it is otherwise, where the bodies move in
opposite directions, or contrary ways, for then the smaller motion
will be destroyed by the stroke, as also an equal quantity of the
greater motion, because action and reaction are equal; and the bodies,
after the stroke, will move together equally swift, with the
<i>difference</i> only of their motions before the stroke; consequently,
that difference is, by means of the stroke, divided between them in
proportion to their quantities of matter.</p>

<p class='c016'>The several particular cases, concerning the collision of bodies, may
be reduced to four general ones; viz.</p>

<p class='c016'>1st. It may be, that one body only is in motion at the
time of the stroke.</p>

<p class='c016'>2nd. They may both move one and the same way.</p>

<p class='c016'>3rd. They may move in direct opposition to each other,
and that with equal quantities of motion.</p>

<p class='c016'>4th. They may be carried with unequal motions in directions
contrary to each other.</p>

<p class='c016'>As the bodies may be either equal or unequal, each of these four
general cases may be considered as consisting of two branches.</p>

<p class='c016'>As to the first, if a body in motion strikes another equal body at
rest, they will, according to the proposition, move together each of
them with one half of the motion that the body had which was in motion
before the stroke; and since the quantity of motion in any body is as
the product arising from the multiplication of its quantity of matter
into its velocity, the common velocity of the two bodies will be but
one half of the velocity of the moving body before the stroke.</p>

<p class='c016'>As to the second general case, where both the bodies are in motion
before the stroke, and move one and the same way. In order to find
their common velocity after impact, let the sum of their motions
before the stroke be divided by the sum of the bodies, and the
quotient will express the common velocity.</p>

<p class='c016'>As to the third general case, where the bodies move in direct
opposition to each other, if they have equal quantities of motion,
they will upon the stroke lose all their motion, and continue at rest;
for, by the proposition, the bodies after impact will be carried with
the difference of their motions before the stroke; which difference,
in such a case, is nothing.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='450' id='Page_450'></span>When two bodies meet with unequal quantities of motion, if the
difference of their motions be divided by the sum of the bodies, the
quotient will express their common velocity after the stroke; for, by
the proposition, the difference of their motions before the stroke is
equal to the sum of their motions after the stroke; consequently, that
difference divided by the sum of the bodies must give the velocity.</p>

<p class='c016'>Such are the principal laws which govern the collision of bodies
devoid of elasticity. The motions of elastic bodies are determined by
different rules: for when they are perfectly elastic, the velocity
gained by the body struck, and the velocity lost by the striking body,
will be twice as great as if the bodies were perfectly inelastic. In
estimating, therefore, the motions of such bodies, we may first
consider what they would have been after impact, had they been
inelastic, and thence deduce the desired conclusion. See Helsham’s
Lectures, a work in which the subject appears to be very clearly
treated.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Karn-brêh hill rises a little to the south-west of Redruth in
Cornwall, to an elevation of 697 feet. Its principal interest is
derived from the speculations of the antiquary, Doctor Borlase, who
regarded it as having been once the grand centre of druidical worship;
and he asserts, in his Antiquities of Cornwall, that, at this very
time, the remains of those monuments which were peculiar to that
priesthood may be discovered, such as <i>rock-basins</i>, <i>circles</i>,
<i>rock-idols</i>, <i>cromlechs</i>, <i>karns</i>, <i>caves</i>, <i>religious enclosures</i>,
<i>logan stones</i>, <i>a gorseddau</i>, or place of elevation, whence the
druids pronounced their decrees, and the traces of a <i>grove of oaks</i>.
This is all very ingenious and imposing, and may be easily believed by
those who have either not visited the spot, or, having visited it, not
viewed the objects with geological eyes. There is no ground whatever
for considering the druidical monuments of Dr. Borlase as the works of
man: on the contrary, they are evidently the results of the operation
of time and the elements, the usual agents employed by Nature in the
decomposition of mountain masses: but the age of antiquarian illusion
is past; the light of geological science has dispelled the phantoms
created by the wizard Fancy, just as the rising sun dissolves
<span class='pageno' title='451' id='Page_451'></span>the mystic forms which the most common object assumes in twilight, when
viewed through the medium of credulity and superstition. The
“rock-basins” of antiquaries are rounded cavities on the surface of
rocks, and are occasionally as spheroidal internally as if they had
been actually formed by a turning-lathe. It was this artificial
appearance which first suggested the hypothesis concerning their
origin, and induced the antiquary to regard them as pools of
lustration. It may, however, be remarked, in the first place, that,
supposing them to have been the works of the druids, these priests
must have been indefatigable artists, for there is scarcely a block of
granite on which one or more of such pools are not visible, although
some are, undoubtedly, much more complete and imposing than others. We
shall introduce to the reader an account of these rock-basins in the
words of their great defender, and we think that he will be amused
with the ingenuity and confidence with which the antiquary dwells upon
every appearance, and bends the facts to suit his favourite theory.
“Since no author has mentioned, and attempted to explain these
monuments, let us see what light and assistance their shape and
structure, exposition, number, and place, considered together with the
customs and known rites of antiquity, may afford us in this untrodden
path. Of these basins there are two sorts; some have lips or channels
to them, others have none; and therefore, as those lips are manifestly
the works of design, not of accident, those that have so material a
difference must needs have been intended for a different use, and yet
both these sorts seem to be the works of the same people, for there is
a multitude of these basins which have no lips or outlets, as well as
those which have, to be seen on Karn-brêh hill, and elsewhere, on
contiguous rocks. Their shape is not uniform; some are quite
irregular, some oval, and some are exactly circular. Their openings do
not converge in the top as a jar or hogshead, but rather spread and
widen, as if to expose the hollow as much as possible to the skies.
Some have little falls into a larger basin, which receives their
tribute, and detains it, having no outlet. Other large ones intermixed
with little ones have passages from one to another, and, by successive
falls uniting, transmit what they receive into one common basin, which
has a drain to it, that serves itself and all the basins above it.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='452' id='Page_452'></span>“The lips do not all point in the same direction, some tending to the
south, some to the west, others to the north, and others again to the
intermediate points of the compass; <i>by which it seems as if the
makers had been determined in this particular, not by any mystical
veneration for one region of the heavens more than another, but by the
shape and inclination of the rock, and for the most easy and
convenient outlet</i>.” We must here beg the reader to pause. The above
remark is really too valuable to be suffered to pass without some
notice. And so the absence of all design and arrangement is adduced as
a proof of their artificial origin! What would Dr. Borlase have said,
had all these lips been found to point in the same direction? But to
proceed:</p>

<p class='c016'>“The size of rock-basins is as different as their shape; they are
formed from six feet to a few inches in diameter. Many uses may
suggest themselves to the imaginations of the curious from the
description of these new, and hitherto scarce-mentioned monuments; in
order, therefore, to obviate some prepossessions, and prevent the mind
from resting so far on groundless suppositions as may make it more
difficult to embrace the truth, I shall first consider what, in all
probability, <i>cannot</i> have been the design of them.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The doctor then proceeds to show that they could never have been
intended for evaporating salt; nor for pounding tin ore, nor for
receiving obelisks, or stone deities, nor for altars; and then
suggests that they could be no other than vessels most ingeniously
contrived for holding holy-water for the rites of washing and
purification. “If,” adds the learned antiquary, “fitness can decide
the use--and where history is deficient, it is all reason that it
should--we shall not long be at a loss. They are mostly placed above
the reach of cattle, frequently above the inspection of man; nay, the
stones which have these basins on them, do not touch the common
ground, but stand on other stones.--Wherefore? but that the water
might neither be really defiled by the former, nor incur the imaginary
impurity, which touching the ground, according to the druid opinion,
gave to every thing that was holy.” We do not know what ideas the
druids entertained with respect to the purity of water, but we have
seen water in some of these pools so impregnated with the excrement of
sea-birds, that we must
<span class='pageno' title='453' id='Page_453'></span>have been as thirsty as Tantalus, before we could have been induced to cool
our tongues with it.</p>

<p class='c016'>“But,” adds Dr. Borlase, “there are some basins which have no lip or
channel; and, therefore, as they could not contribute any of their
water to the common store, they <i>must</i> have been appropriated to
another use; and since these are found in the same places with the
others above-mentioned which have outlets or mouths to them, they must
have been subservient to the same system of superstition, though in a
different method.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“These basins are sometimes found near twenty feet high from the
common surface; and, therefore, being so withdrawn from vulgar eyes,
so elevated from the ground, which was supposed, as I said before, to
defile all, they had likely a proportionably greater degree of
reverence, and their waters accounted more holy, and more
efficacious.”</p>

<p class='c016'>We shall not trouble the reader with any further quotations from this
learned antiquary, except in concluding the history, after the fashion
of melo-dramatists, with a splendid scene, in which, with the author’s
assistance, we shall bring all the performers on the stage, dressed in
appropriate costume, and surrounded by all the pomp of druidical

<p class='c016'>“From these basins,” says Dr. Borlase, “on solemn occasions the
officiating druid, standing on an eminence, sanctified the
congregation with a more than ordinarily precious lustration before he
expounded to them, or prayed for them, or gave forth his decisions.
This water he drank, or purified his hands in, before it touched any
other vessel, and was consequently accounted more sacred than the
other holy-water. To these more private basins, during the time of
libation, the priest might have recourse, and be at liberty to judge
by the quantity, colour, motion, and other appearances in the water,
of future events, of dubious cases, without danger of contradiction
from the people below. This water might serve to mix their mistletoe
withal, as a general antidote: for, doubtless, those who would not let
it touch the ground, would not mix this their divinity (the mistletoe)
with common water. Oak leaves, without which the druid rites did
scarce ever proceed, ritually gathered and infused, might make some
very medicinal or incantorial potion. Lastly, libations of water were
never to be made to their gods, but when they
<span class='pageno' title='454' id='Page_454'></span>consisted of this purest of all water, as what was immediately come
from the heavens, and partly therefore thither to be returned, before
it touched any other water or any other vessel whatsoever, placed on
the ground.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“As <i>logan</i>, or rocking-stones, were some of the <i>piæ fraudes</i> of the
druids, the basins found on them might be used to promote the juggle;
by the motion of the stone the water might be so agitated, as to
delude the enquirer by a pretended miracle; might make the criminal
confess; satisfy the credulous; bring forth the gold of the rich; and
make the injured, rich as well as poor, acquiesce in what the druid
thought proper.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Sorry are we to destroy a web which has been so ingeniously woven by
its author; but the interests of truth admit not of compromise. Dr.
Macculloch, in an interesting paper, published in the Transactions of
the Geological Society, on the decomposition of the granite tors of
Cornwall, has justly observed, that the true nature of these
rock-basins may be easily traced by inspecting the rocks themselves.
On examination, they will always be found to contain distinct grains
of <i>quartz</i>, and fragments of the other constituent parts of the
granite. A small force is sufficient to detach from the sides of these
cavities additional fragments, showing that a process of decomposition
is still going on under favourable circumstances. The principal of
these circumstances is the presence of water, or rather the alternate
action of air and water. If a drop of water can only make an effectual
lodgement on a surface of this granite, a small cavity is sure to be
sooner or later produced; this will insensibly enlarge as it becomes
capable of holding more water; and the sides, as they continue to
waste, will necessarily retain an even and rounded cavity, on account
of the uniform texture of the rock. This explanation is sufficiently
satisfactory: in addition to which, it may be stated, that these very
basins not unfrequently occur on the perpendicular sides of rocks, as
may be distinctly seen in the granite of Scilly, and in the gritstone
rocks in the park of the late Sir Joseph Banks, in the parish of
Ashover, in Derbyshire; a fact which at once excludes the idea of
their artificial origin.</p>

<p class='c016'>The other grotesque and whimsical appearances of rocky masses, such as
<i>rock idols</i>, <i>logan stones</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> are to be explained by the
tendency which granite possesses of wearing
<span class='pageno' title='455' id='Page_455'></span>more rapidly on the angles and edges than on the sides; thus, then,
upon simple and philosophical principles, are such appearances to be
satisfactorily accounted for, and the <i>phantasmagoria</i> of Borlase
vanishes as the light penetrates the theatre so long dedicated to its
exhibition.</p>

<p class='c016'>We shall conclude this note with a few observations upon the
celebrated logan, or logging, stone, near the Land’s End, Cornwall, of
which we present our readers with a faithful sketch.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id044'>
<img src='images/figp472.png' alt='Mound of stone with a boulder balanced atop a point in the middle.' class='ig044' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>The foundation of this part of the coast is a stupendous group of
granite rocks, which rise in pyramidal clusters to a great altitude,
and overhang the sea. The celebrated <i>logan stone</i> here represented is
an immense block weighing above sixty tons. The surface in contact
with the under rock is of very small extent, and the whole mass is so
nicely balanced, that, notwithstanding its magnitude, the strength of
a single man applied to its under edge is sufficient to make it
oscillate. It is the nature of granite to disintegrate into rhomboidal
and tabular masses, which, by
<span class='pageno' title='456' id='Page_456'></span>the further operation of air and moisture, gradually lose their solid
angles, and approach the spheroidal form. The fact of the upper part
of the cliff being more exposed to atmospheric agency than the parts
beneath, will sufficiently explain why these rounded masses so
frequently rest on blocks which still preserve the tabular form; and
since such spheroidal blocks must obviously rest in that position in
which their lesser axes are perpendicular to the horizon, it is
equally evident that, whenever an adequate force is applied, they must
vibrate on their point of support.</p>

<p class='c016'>Although we are thus led to deny the druidical origin of this stone,
for which so many zealous antiquaries have contended, still we by no
means intend to deny that the druids employed it as an engine of
superstition; it is possible that, having observed so curious a
property, they dexterously contrived to make it answer the purposes of
an ordeal, and, by regarding it as the <i>touch-stone</i> of truth,
acquitted or condemned the accused by its motions. Mason poetically
alludes to this supposed property in the following lines:--</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>We are indebted to Sir Everard Home for a description of that peculiar
structure by which several species of animals are enabled to sustain
their bodies in opposition to the force of gravity. His first paper
upon this subject is published in the 106th volume of the
Philosophical Transactions, in which he says, he was not aware that
any animal, larger than the house-fly, was endowed by nature with such
a power, so as to admit of examination, until Sir Joseph Banks
mentioned that the <i>lacerta gecko</i>, a species of lizard, which is a
native of the island of Java, comes out of an evening from the roofs
of the houses, and walks down the smooth, hard, and polished chinam
walls, in search of the flies which settle upon them, and which are
its natural
<span class='pageno' title='457' id='Page_457'></span>food, and then runs up again to the roof of the house. Sir Joseph, while at
Batavia, amused himself with catching this animal, by standing close
to the wall, at some distance from the lizard, with a long flattened
pole, which being made suddenly to scrape the surface of the wall,
knocked the animal down. He presented Sir Everard with a specimen
weighing five ounces and three quarters, avoirdupois, which enabled
him to ascertain the peculiar mechanism by which the feet of this
animal can keep their hold of a smooth, hard, perpendicular wall, and
carry up so large a weight as that of its body.</p>

<p class='c016'>The foot has five toes, at the end of each of which, except that of
the thumb, is a very sharp and much curved claw; on the under surface
of each toe are sixteen transverse slits, leading to so many cavities
or pockets, the depth of which is nearly equal to the length of the
slit that forms the orifice; they all open forward, and the external
edge of each opening is serrated, like the teeth of a small-toothed
comb. The cavities, or pockets, are lined with a cuticle, and the
serrated edges are also covered with it. The structure just described
is supplied with various muscles, whose action is to draw down the
claw, open the orifices of the pockets, and turn down the serrated
edges upon the surface on which the animal stands. Upon examining
attentively the under surface of the toes, when the pockets are
closed, Sir Everard Home was struck with their resemblance to the
surfaces of that portion of the <i>Echineis remora</i>, or sucking fish, by
which it attaches itself to the shark, or to the bottom of ships; and
it consequently suggested the probability of obtaining, from an
examination of this latter apparatus, much useful information which
might be applicable to the subject of the lizard, more especially as
the parts of which it is composed are so much larger, and therefore
more within the reach of anatomical examination.</p>

<p class='c016'>The surface on the top of the head of this fish, fitted for adhesion,
is of an oval form, and bears a considerable proportion to the size of
the whole animal; it is surrounded by a broad, loose, movable edge,
capable of applying itself closely to the surface on which it is
placed; and it is evident that when the external edge is so applied,
and the cartilaginous plates are raised up, the interstices must
become so many vacua, and the serrated edge of each
<span class='pageno' title='458' id='Page_458'></span>plate will keep a sufficient hold of the substance on which it rests to
retain it in that position, assisted by the pressure of the
surrounding water, without a continuance of muscular exertion. It thus
appears that the adhesion of the <i>sucking fish</i> is produced by so many
vacua being formed through an apparatus worked by the voluntary
muscles of the animal, and the pressure of the surrounding water.</p>

<p class='c016'>From the similarity of the mechanism of the under surface of the toes
of the <i>lacerta gecko</i>, there can be no doubt that the purpose to
which it is applied is the same: but as in the one case the adhesion
is to take place under water, and is to continue for longer periods,
the means are more simple; in the other, where the mechanism is to be
employed in air, under greater disadvantages with respect to gravity,
and is to last for very short periods, and then immediately afterwards
to be renewed, a more delicate structure of parts, a greater
proportional depth of cavities, and more complex muscular structure,
become necessary.</p>

<p class='c016'>Having ascertained the principle on which an animal of so large a size
as the <i>lacerta gecko</i> is enabled to support itself in its progressive
motion against gravity, Sir E. Home felt himself more competent to
inquire into the mechanism by which the common fly is enabled, with so
much facility, to support itself in still more disadvantageous
situations. In the natural size the feet of the fly are so small, that
nothing can be determined respecting them; Keller was the first person
who made a drawing of the fly’s foot in a highly magnified state, in
which the concave surfaces are visible, and which, no doubt, like
those of the lizard above described, are employed to form vacua, which
enable the fly to move under such disadvantageous circumstances. Mr.
Bauer, who has so greatly distinguished himself in microscopic
researches, was judiciously enlisted into the service of Sir E. Home
upon this occasion; and he has shown that this principle, on which
progressive motion against gravity depends, is very extensively
employed by nature in the structure of the feet of insects; and Sir
Everard observes, that, now this structure is known, it can be readily
demonstrated by looking at the movement of the feet of any insect upon
the inside of a glass tumbler, through a common magnifying glass; the
different suckers are readily seen separately to be pulled off from
the surface of the glass, and reapplied to another part.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='459' id='Page_459'></span>In consequence of the expedition to the polar regions, Sir E. Home was
enabled to obtain and examine the foot of the walrus, in which he
detected a resemblance in structure to that of the fly; and it is not
a little curious that two animals so different in size should have
feet so similar in their use. In the fly the parts require to be
magnified one hundred times to render the structure distinctly
visible; and in the walrus the parts are so large, as to require being
reduced four diameters, to bring them within the size of a quarto
page.</p>

<p class='c016'>Nor is progressive motion, the only function in which Nature avails
herself of the pressure of the atmosphere for the accomplishment of
her purposes. The act of feeding is continually effected in this
manner. The operation of sucking is too familiar to require comment.
It may not, perhaps, be so generally known, that it is by the very
same process that bees reach the fine dust and juices of hollow
flowers, like the honeysuckle, and some species of foxglove, which are
too narrow to admit them. They fill up the mouth of the flower with
their bodies, and suck out the air, or at least a large portion of it,
by which the soft sides of the flower are made to collapse, and the
juice and dust are squeezed towards the insect, as completely as if
the hand had pressed it externally. It is by a similar process that
the oyster is enabled to close its shell so firmly; for, if a hole be
bored in it, it may be opened without the least difficulty.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Those who are not acquainted with the operations by which the mind is
enabled to arrive at truth, are too apt to attribute to accident that
which is the result of great intellectual labour and acuteness.
Observation, analogy, and experiment are the three great
stepping-stones by which the philosopher is enabled to ascend from
darkness to light: it is true that his foot may accidentally be placed
upon the first, but his own efforts are required to complete the
ascent. To the mass of mankind the preliminary step is obvious, and
they at once conclude that the succeeding ones are equally easy and
simple. In this view of the subject, it was by accident that Sir Isaac
Newton discovered the laws of gravitation, for his mind was directed
to the investigation by the accidental fall of an apple from its
tree;
<span class='pageno' title='460' id='Page_460'></span>it was by accident that Galileo discovered the isochronous movement of the
pendulum, for it was suggested by the vibration of a chandelier: but
how many persons might have witnessed the fall of an apple, or the
vibration of a chandelier, without arriving at similar truths? It has
been said that we are indebted for the important invention in the
steam-engine, termed <i>hand gear</i>, by which its valves or cocks are
worked by the machine itself, to an idle boy of the name of Humphrey
Potter, who, being employed to stop and open a valve, saw that he
could save himself the trouble of attending and watching it, by fixing
a plug upon a part of the machine which came to the place at the
proper times, in consequence of the general movement. If this anecdote
be true, what does it prove? That Humphrey Potter might be very idle,
but that he was, at the same time, very ingenious. It was a
contrivance, not the result of accident, but of acute observation and
successful experiment. Glass is said to have been discovered by
persons having accidentally kindled a fire on the sandy shore with
sea-weed, when the alkali from the ashes united with the silex of the
sand; and Pliny tells us that <i>minium</i>, or red lead, was first
recognised, in consequence of a fire that took place at the Piræus at
Athens, where some <i>ceruse</i>, which had been exposed to the fire, had
been found converted into a red substance. A thousand such accidents
might be related, were we not affording a sample rather than a
catalogue. We are endeavouring to combat a popular but mischievous
error; and we are happy at finding the same feeling expressed in a
work which, from its extensive circulation, must prove highly useful
in correcting it. “Very few discoveries,” says the author, “have been
made by chance and by ignorant persons; much fewer than is generally
supposed. They are generally made by persons of competent knowledge,
and who are in search of them. The improvement of the steam-engine by
Watt resulted from the most learned investigation of mathematical,
mechanical, and chemical truths. Arkwright devoted many years, five at
least, to his invention of spinning-jennies. The new process of
refining sugar, by which more money has been made in a shorter time,
and with less risk and trouble, than was perhaps ever gained by an
invention, was discovered by Mr. Howard, a most accomplished chemist,
and it was the fruit of a long course of experiments, in the progress
<span class='pageno' title='461' id='Page_461'></span>of which, known philosophical principles were constantly applied, and one
or two new principles ascertained.”--<i>Library of Useful Knowledge.</i></p>

</div>

<p class='c016'>If we include the pressure of the atmosphere, a body at the depth of
100 feet would sustain that of 60 pounds on the square inch; while one
at 4,000 feet, a depth by no means considerable, it would be exposed
to a pressure of about 1,830 pounds. We need not, therefore, feel
surprised, that on the foundering of a ship at sea, though its timbers
part, not a spar floats to the surface; for if the hull has sunk to a
great depth, all that is porous is penetrated with water or greatly
compressed. Captain Scoresby states that when, by the entangling of
the line of the harpoon, a boat was carried down with the whale, it
required after it was recovered two boats to keep it at the surface.
Sir J. Herschel has recorded a melancholy anecdote, which may well be
adduced in farther illustration of our subject:--“After the invention
of the diving-bell, and its success in sub-aqueous processes, it was
considered highly desirable to devise some means of remaining for any
length of time under water, and rising at pleasure without any
assistance. Some years ago an ingenious individual proposed a project
by which this end was to be accomplished. It consisted in sinking the
hull of a ship made quite water-tight, with the decks and sides
strongly supported by shores, and the only entry secured by a stout
trap-door, in such a manner, that by disengaging from within the
weights employed to sink it, it might rise of itself to the surface.
To render the trial more satisfactory, the projector himself made the
first essay. It was agreed that he should sink in twenty fathoms
water, and rise again without assistance at the expiration of
twenty-four hours. Accordingly, making all secure, and provided with
the means of making signals to indicate his situation, this unhappy
victim of his own ingenuity entered and was sunk. No signal was made,
and the time appointed elapsed. The pressure of the water at so great
a depth had, no doubt, been completely under-estimated, and the sides
of the vessel being at once crushed in, the unfortunate projector
perished, before he could even make the signal concerted to indicate
his distress.”</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>If a soap-bubble be blown up, and set under a glass, so that the
motion of the air may not affect it, as the water glides down the
sides and the top grows thinner, several colours will successively
appear at the top, and spread themselves from thence in rings down the
sides of the bubble, till they vanish in the same order in which they
appeared; at last a black spot appears at the top, and spreads till
the bubble bursts. Hence it follows that the colours of a body depend
in some degree upon the thickness and density of the particles that
compose it; and that, if the density be changed, the colour will
likewise be changed. That the production of colours depends upon the
nature of the surfaces upon which light falls, is beautifully
exemplified by the iridescence of mother of pearl; and which has been
satisfactorily shown to depend upon a singular peculiarity in the
structure of that substance. On its surface, which to the unassisted
eye, and even to the touch, appears to be finely polished, there are
innumerable little lines, or <i>grooves</i>, in some places as many as two
or three thousand in the space of an inch, which, lying parallel,
regularly follow each other in all their windings; by the edges of
which the rays of light are reflected, and the continual change of
colour arises from their continual bendings. Whatever doubts might
have existed upon the subject, some late experiments of Dr. Brewster
have dissipated them, by showing that the colours which play so
beautifully on the surface of mother of pearl, may be communicated by
pressure to sealing-wax and several other substances. The discovery of
this fact was in some measure accidental; he had stuck a piece of
mother of pearl on a cement made of rosin and bees-wax, and on
separating this cement he found that it had acquired the property of
exhibiting colours. Several persons who witnessed the effect,
concluded that it arose from the presence of a thin film of the mother
of pearl, which might have scaled off and adhered to the wax: but such
an explanation was at once refuted, by plunging the wax in acid, which
must have dissolved the mother of pearl, had any
<span class='pageno' title='463' id='Page_463'></span>been present; but the acid had no effect, and the colours of the impression
remained unimpaired. It is clear, then, that it is the grooves, as Dr.
Brewster conjectured, which occasion the iridescence in the mother of
pearl, as well as in the waxen impression. In consequence of this
curious discovery, Mr. Barton succeeded in producing the same
appearance on glass, and on different metals, by simply cutting
grooved lines on their surface. These lines are so fine that, without
a microscope, they are scarcely visible, and the glass and the metal
appear to retain their polish: yet they and the colours also may be
communicated by an impression, like those from the mother of pearl, to
the wax. In like manner the varying and delicate hues exhibited by the
wings of certain butterflies, arise from the action of light upon the
parallel and equidistant striæ upon their surfaces.</p>

<p class='c016'>The following are a few of those plants which indicate changes in the

<p class='c016'><i>Chickweed</i> is an excellent barometer. When the flower expands fully,
we are not to expect rain for several hours; should it continue in
that state, no rain will disturb the summer’s day. When it half
conceals its miniature flower, the day is generally showery; but, if
it entirely shuts up, or veils the white flower with its green mantle,
let the traveller take the hint and put on his great-coat. The
different species of <i>trefoil</i> always contract their leaves at the
approach of a storm; so certainly does this take place, that these
plants have acquired the name of the <i>husbandman’s barometer</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>The tulip and several of the compound yellow flowers also close before
rain. There is, besides, a species of wood-sorrel, which doubles its
leaves before storms and tempests. The <i>bauhinia</i>, or mountain ebony,

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The popular adage of <i>Forty days’ rain after St. Swithin</i>, is a
tradition which seems to have derived its origin from the following
circumstance. Swithin, or <i>Swithum</i>, bishop of Winchester, who died in
868, desired that he might be
<span class='pageno' title='464' id='Page_464'></span>buried in the open church-yard, and not in the chancel of the minster, as was
usual with other bishops; and his request was complied with; but the
monks, on his being canonized, considering it disgraceful for the
saint to lie in a public cemetery, resolved to remove the body into
the choir, which was to have been done with solemn procession on the
15th of July. It rained, however, so violently for forty days together
at this season, that the design was abandoned. “Now, without entering
into the case of the bishop,” says Mr. Howard, in his work on the
Climate of London, “who was probably a man of sense, and wished to set
the example of a more wholesome, as well as a more humble, mode of
resigning the perishable clay to the destructive elements, I may
observe, that the fact of the hindrance of the ceremony by the cause
related is sufficiently authenticated by tradition; and the tradition
is so far valuable, as it proves that the summers in this southern
part of our island, were subject, a thousand years ago, to occasional
heavy rains, in the same way as at present.” Mr. Howard has shown, by
a table, that the notion commonly entertained on this subject, if put
strictly to the test of experience, at any one station, in this part
of the island, will be found fallacious; he, however, very justly
observes, that “the opinion of the people on subjects connected with
Natural History is commonly founded, in some degree, on fact or
experience;” and to do justice to the popular observation in question,
he states that, “in a majority of our summers, a showery period,
which, with some latitude as to time and local circumstances, may be
admitted to constitute daily rain for forty days, does come on about
the time indicated by this tradition; not that any long space before
is often so dry as to mark distinctly its commencement.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Did the whale know his own power, he would easily destroy all the
machinery which the art of man could devise for catching him; it would
be only necessary for him to swim on the surface in a straight line in
order to break the thickest rope; but the fish, on being struck by the
harpoon, obeys a natural instinct, which, in this instance, betrays
him to his death. Sir H. Davy, in his Salmonia, observes, that the
whale, not having an air-bladder, can
<span class='pageno' title='465' id='Page_465'></span>sink to the lowest depths of the ocean, and mistaking the harpoon for the
teeth of a sword-fish, or a shark, he instantly descends, this being
his manner of freeing himself from these enemies, who cannot bear the
pressure of a deep ocean; and from ascending and descending in small
space, he thus puts himself in the power of the whaler.--<i>See <a href='#note30'>Note 30</a>.</i></p>

<p class='c016'>To render the subject to which this note refers farther intelligible,
we may show the means by which a fish moves forward in the water. The
accompanying diagram and demonstration are from Dr. Roget’s
Bridgewater Treatise.</p>

<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/figp482.png' alt='Diagram of fish’s motion.' class='c036' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>The tail is the principal instrument by which the progressive motion
is effected. Thus--suppose that the tail is inclined to the right; if,
in this situation, the muscles of the left side, tending to bring the
tail in a right line with the body, are suddenly thrown into action,
the resistance of the water, by reacting against the broad surface of
the tail in the direction P R, perpendicularly to that surface, will
cause the muscular action to give the whole body an impulse in that
direction; and the centre of gravity, C, will move onwards in the
direction C B, parallel to P R. This impulse is not destroyed by the
farther flexion of the tail towards the left side, because the
principal force exerted by the muscles has already been expended in
the motion from R to M, in bringing it to a straight line with the
body; and the force which carries it on to L is much weaker, and
therefore occasions a more feeble reaction. When the tail has arrived
at the position L, indicated by the dotted outline, a similar action
of the muscles on the right side will create a resistance and an
impulse in the direction of K L, and a motion of the whole body in the
same direction, C A. These impulses being repeated in quick
succession, the fish moves forward in the diagonal C D, intermediate
between the direction of the two forces.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='466' id='Page_466'></span>Upon the same principle a boat is impelled by paddling; and the action
of the rudder of a ship in turning the vessel will be readily
understood. In this latter case, however, there is an additional
mechanical advantage; since the point round which the vessel turns, is
beyond the middle and towards the prow, and hence the force applied at
the extremity of the keel acts as by an arm of a lever.</p>

</div>

<p class='c016'>In appreciating the mechanical means by which a bird is enabled to
direct its course, we must not omit to take into account the power it
possesses of changing the position of the centre of gravity of its
body, so that the reaction of the air may be modified with regard to
each wing.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The command possessed by insects in directing and changing their
course, seems more perfect even than that of birds. Many of them
travel on their wings to immense distances, and, considering their
comparative size, they generally move through the air with greater
velocity than that of birds. Bees have been known to fly great
distances from their hive, in search of food; and the silk-worm moth
has travelled more than a hundred miles in a very short space of time.
Many of our readers have, no doubt, noticed with surprise the apparent
facility with which gnats have accompanied them, although they may
have been advancing on horseback at a full gallop; and the author
during the last summer has been forcibly struck with the manner in
which flies and other insects have kept up with a railway carriage,
alternately flying in and out of the vehicles, as though they had been
at perfect rest. Some species possess a remarkable power of poising
themselves in the air, and hovering for a length of time over the same
spot, without falling or rising, advancing or retreating; the
<i>Dragon-fly</i> affords a striking example of this fact.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>In consequence of the manner in which the wings are affixed to the
scapula, they give a stroke to the air in a direction both downwards
and backwards; so that while the former supports the bird, the latter
impels it forward. It is curious
<span class='pageno' title='467' id='Page_467'></span>to notice that the degree of this obliquity varies in different birds,
and is evidently adapted to their habits: thus, for instance, birds of
prey have a great obliquity of wing, which better enables them to
pursue their victims in a horizontal course; while those birds which
soar to a considerable elevation, in a nearly vertical direction, as
the <i>Lark</i>, have scarcely any obliquity of wing, but strike directly
downwards.</p>

<p class='c016'>The sea and land breezes which occur in the islands of the torrid
zone, very strikingly illustrate the position laid down in the text,
and afford a good explanation of the manner in which winds may be
occasioned by a change of temperature in the air. In these, during the
hottest part of the day, the wind sets in from all quarters, and
appears to be blowing towards the centre of the island, while in the
night it changes its direction, and blows from the centre of the land
towards the sea; for since the sun’s rays produce much more heat by
their reflection from land than they do from water, that portion of
air which is over the land will soon become heated, and will ascend; a
rarefaction and diminution of the quantity of air over the central
part of the land will be thus occasioned, which must be supplied from
the sides; but, as the land cools again during the night, that portion
of air which had been previously heaped up will begin to descend, and
by spreading and equalizing itself will produce a breeze blowing from
the centre.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='468' id='Page_468'></span>The <i>trade-winds</i>, so called from the advantage which their certainty
affords to trading vessels, are another example of the same kind; they
are generally stated to blow from east to west over the equator, and
are occasioned by the rarefaction of the air by the sun’s heat, and
the motion of the earth from west to east. While writing the present
note, we have seen an essay upon the subject by Captain Basil Hall,
published in an appendix to Mr. Daniel’s admirable work on
Meteorology: the perusal of this paper has induced us to cancel what
we had written, and to refer the reader to the essay itself; for it is
quite impossible to do justice to the views it entertains, in the
limited space necessarily prescribed to us in this note.</p>

<p class='c016'>On the coast of Guinea, the wind always sets in upon the land, blowing
westerly instead of easterly; this exception arises from the deserts
of Africa, which lie near the equator, and being a very sandy soil,
reflect a great degree of heat into the air above them, which being
thus rendered lighter than that which is over the sea, the wind
continually rushes in upon the land to restore the equilibrium.</p>

<p class='c016'>Among the irregular winds, or those which are not constant, but
accidental, may be noticed the <i>whirlwind</i>, the <i>harmattan</i>, and the
<i>sirocco</i>. The first of these is occasioned by the meeting of two or
more currents of wind from opposite directions, and which can only be
occasioned by some temporary but violent disturbance of equilibrium.
The <i>harmattan</i> is met with on the western coast of Africa, and is
generally attended by great heat and fog; it appears to be occasioned
by a conflict between the heated sands of Africa, and the regular
direction of the trade-winds over that continent, and, by disturbing
their progress, it is frequently the forerunner of a hurricane in the
West Indies. The <i>sirocco</i> occurs in Egypt, the Mediterranean, and in
Greece, and is chiefly characterised by its unhealthy qualities. The
air, by passing over the heated sands of Egypt, becomes so dried and
rarefied as to be scarcely fit for respiration, and, being thus
prepared, it absorbs so much humidity on passing the Mediterranean as
to form a suffocating and oppressive kind of fog.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Daniel observes, that the currents of a heated room, in some
measure, exemplify the great currents of the atmosphere. If the door
be opened, the flame of a candle held to the upper part will show, by
its inclination, a current
<span class='pageno' title='469' id='Page_469'></span>flowing outwards; but, if held near the floor, it will be directed inwards. If
the door be closed suddenly from without, it moves with the in-coming
current, and against the out-going, and a condensation of air takes
place in the room; which is proved by the rattling of the windows, and
the bursting open of any door in the room, if slightly closed. If the
door close from within, it moves against the in-coming current, and
with the out-going, and a rarefaction of the air in the room takes
place; which is evidenced by the rattling of the windows, and the
bursting open of another door in the contrary direction.</p>

<p class='c016'>Meteorology has been long considered the least perfect branch of
natural knowledge; so apparently capricious and irregular are its
phenomena, that philosophers had almost abandoned the idea of bringing
them under the operation of any general laws. Brighter lights are,
however, now dawning upon us. Mr. Whewell, in his Bridgewater
Treatise, has explained the manner in which the various currents of
the atmosphere maintain a necessary balance in the distribution of
heat and moisture around the globe, and has thus reduced to order and
design phenomena which have hitherto been regarded as unconnected and
fortuitous. Lieut.-Col. Reid, by his late happy investigation of the
law of storms, will, no doubt, lead us into a novel path of the most
important discoveries. He has satisfactorily proved, by a mass of
evidence derived from numerous logbooks, that storms obey fixed laws.
His attention was ardently directed to the subject by having been at
Barbadoes immediately after the great hurricane of 1831, which in the
short space of seven hours killed upwards of 1400 persons on that
island alone. The discoveries of Col. Reid may be thus briefly
stated.--That hurricanes are whirlwinds of great diameter, always
revolving according to an invariable law, viz. from right to left
(supposing yourself standing in the centre), or in the opposite way to
the hands of a watch, in the northern hemisphere, and in a contrary
direction in southern latitudes; at the same time they have a
progressive motion in a curved line, and as they advance their
diameters appear to enlarge and their violence to diminish; it has
been also found that in the centre of the vortex there is a lull, or
calm. Col. Reid observes that the simplest mode of illustrating the
subject is to cut out concentric circles, so as to represent
progressive whirlwinds, by moving which
<span class='pageno' title='470' id='Page_470'></span>over any tract, the veering of the wind will be easily understood. The
reader may form a more familiar idea by causing the water to circulate
in a basin, which will represent the violent circular motion of the
storm-wind, with a calm in the centre of the vortex. Suppose this to
be also moving onward at a rate of about seven miles an hour, and he
will have a correct notion of the subject. Since the storms expand in
size and diminish in force as they proceed towards the poles, and the
meridians at the same time approach each other, gales become huddled
together; and hence, apparently, the true cause of the very
complicated nature of the winds in our latitude. Observations would
also appear to render it probable that there exists an accordance of
the force of storms with the law of magnetic intensity; for example,
it is at its minimum at St. Helena, where storms never occur; on the
contrary, the lines of greatest intensity seem to correspond with the
latitudes of typhoons and hurricanes. To what important discoveries
may not the pursuit of this enquiry lead us?</p>

<p class='c016'>The practical importance of the foregoing facts must be obvious: to
use the expression of Sir John Herschel, “they will teach seamen how
to steer their ships, and save thousands of lives.” They will thus
learn on which side to lay-to a ship in a storm, for, by watching the
veering of the wind, they will ascertain the direction in which it is
falling; if violent, and the changes sudden, the ship will probably be
near the centre of the vortex; whereas, if the wind blows a great
length of time from the same point, and the changes are gradual, it
may reasonably be supposed the ship is near the extremity of it. The
barometer also becomes a very important instrument upon these
occasions; the rapid rotatory motion of a column of the atmosphere
necessarily occasions its fall, and this fall is always greatest at
the centre of the storm. When it begins to rise, the centre has
passed, and when the wind has sufficiently abated to enable a ship to
make sail, she may then bear away with safety; but near the middle of
the hurricane, before the barometer begins to rise, all square-sails
must be dangerous.</p>

<p class='c016'>In order to show the dandyism displayed by the archers of former

arrows green. A wardrobe account of the 4 Edw. II. furnishes an entry
for peacock arrows, “Pro duodecim flecchiis cum pennis de <i>pavone</i>,

<p class='c016'>As this note has some connexion with the shuttlecock,<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c017'><sup>[84]</sup></a> as well as
the arrow, we may take this opportunity of introducing a passage,
which was accidentally omitted in the text; it refers to the method of
playing this game at Turon, in Cochin China; and which is described by
a traveller
<span class='pageno' title='472' id='Page_472'></span>as follows:--“Instead of using a battledoor,<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c017'><sup>[85]</sup></a> as is the custom in
England, the players stood seven or eight in a circle; and after
running a short race, and springing from the floor, they met the
descending shuttlecock with the sole of the foot, and drove it up
again with force high in the air. The game was kept up with much
animation, and seldom did the players miss their stroke, or give it a
wrong direction. The shuttlecock was made of a piece of dried skin
rolled round, and bound with strings. Into this skin were inserted
three feathers, spreading out at top, but so near to each other, where
they were stuck into the skin, as to pass through the holes, little
more than a quarter of an inch square, which were always made in the
centre of Cochin copper coins. We made one or two awkward attempts at
the game, not only to our own confusion, but much to the amusement of
the natives. It must, however, be remembered, that, amongst these
ingenious people, the feet assist, as auxiliaries to the hands, in the
exercise of many trades, particularly that of boat-building.”</p>

<p class='c016'>A beautiful experiment was lately instituted at Paris, to illustrate

as the aperture of the tube; and in the centre of this ring, in the
mouth of the tube, was suspended a clock-bell and hammer. The hammer
was made to strike the ring and the bell at the same instant, so that
the sound of the ring would be transmitted to the remote end of the
tube through the conducting power of the matter of the tube itself;
while the sound of the bell would be transmitted through the medium of
the air included within the tube. The ear being then placed at the
remote end of the tube, the sound of the ring, transmitted by the
metal of the tube, was first distinctly heard; and, after a short
interval had elapsed, the sound of the bell, transmitted by the air in
the tube, was heard. The result of several experiments was, that the
metal of the tube conducted the sound with about ten and a half times
the velocity with which it was conducted by the air; that is, at the
rate of about 11,865 feet per second.</p>

<p class='c016'>The biographer of Josquin des Prez, the celebrated musician, and
<i>maestro di capella</i> to Louis XII. King of France, relates an anecdote
which may be here told in connexion with the present subject. When
Josquin was first admitted into the service of the French monarch, he
had been promised a benefice by his Majesty; but this Prince, contrary
to his usual habits, for he was in general both just and liberal,
forgot the promise he had made; when Josquin, after suffering great
inconvenience from the shortness of his Majesty’s memory, ventured by
the following expedient to remind him publicly of his promise without
giving offence. He had been commanded to compose a motet for the
Chapel Royal, on which occasion he selected part of the 119th Psalm,
“<i>Memor esto verbi tui servo tuo</i>”--“<i>Oh think of thy servant, as
concerning thy word</i>,” which he set in so supplicating and exquisite a
manner, that it was universally admired, particularly by the King, who
was not only touched by the music, but felt the words so effectually,
that he soon afterwards granted his petition, by conferring on him the
promised preferment. For which act of justice and munificence,
Josquin, with equal felicity, composed as a hymn of gratitude another
part of the same Psalm,--“<i>Bonitatem fecisti cum servo tuo,
Domine</i>”--“<i>Oh Lord, thou has dealt graciously with thy servant.</i>”</p>

<p class='c016'>Josquin, among musicians, was the giant of his time, and seems to have
arrived at universal monarchy and dominion over the affections and
passions of the musical part of mankind; indeed, his compositions were
as well known and as much practised throughout Europe at the beginning
of the sixteenth century, as those of Handel were in Europe sixty
years ago.</p>

<p class='c016'>The following case, quoted by Sir David Brewster, in his work on
“Natural Magic,” from the life of Peter Heaman, a Swede, who was
executed for piracy and murder at Leith in 1822, will afford a very
curious example of the influence of the imagination in creating
distinct forms out of an irregularly shaded surface. “One remarkable
thing was, one day as we mended a sail, it being a very thin one,
after laying it upon deck in folds, I took the tar-brush and tarred
<span class='pageno' title='474' id='Page_474'></span>it over in the places which I thought needed to be strengthened. But when
we hoisted it up, I was astonished to see that the tar I had put upon
it represented a gallows and a man under it without a head. The head
was lying beside him. He was complete, body, thighs, legs, arms, and
in every shape like a man. Now, I oftentimes made remarks upon it, and
repeated them to the others. I always said to them all, ‘You may
depend upon it that something will happen.’ I afterwards took down the
sail on a calm day, and sewed a piece of canvass over the figure to
cover it, for I could not bear to have it always before my eyes.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The curious effect of chance resemblance was particularly remarked by
Leonardo da Vinci in the moss and stains on old stones. And, in our
own times, this faculty of the imagination has not unfrequently been
enlisted into the service of the fortune-teller for purposes of fraud
and imposition. The following story is related on credible testimony.
“A British officer, in expectation of promotion, and of being united
to a lady in marriage, sought a gipsy fortune-teller. The sorceress,
no doubt, had made herself well acquainted with these circumstances.
On entering the room, she ordered a large glass of spring-water, into
which she poured the white of a newly-laid egg. After shaking the
mixture for some time, she so far succeeded as to induce the credulous
observer to declare that he saw most distinctly the image of the ship
in which he was to hoist his flag, the church in which he was to be
married, and his bride going with him into the church.”--<i>The Gipsies’

<p class='c016'>Dr. Wollaston, in a paper published in the Philosophical Transactions,
(1807, p. 133,) relates some interesting observations he made on the
progressive changes of these rings, and which satisfactorily explain
their origin. He observed, that some species of fungi were always to
be found at the exterior margin of the dark ring of grass if examined
at the proper season. The position of the fungi led him to believe,
that progressive increase from a central point was the probable mode
of formation of the ring; and he thought it likely that the soil which
had once contributed to the support of fungi, might be so exhausted as
to be rendered incapable of producing a second crop. The
<span class='pageno' title='475' id='Page_475'></span>defect of nutriment on one side would occasion the new roots to extend
themselves solely in the opposite direction, and would cause the
circle of fungi continually to proceed, by annual enlargement, from
the centre outwards. The luxuriance of the grass follows as a natural
consequence, as the soil of an interior circle is enriched by the
decayed roots of fungi of the succeeding year’s growth. During the
growth of fungi, they so entirely absorb all nutriment from the soil
beneath, that the herbage is often for a while destroyed, and a ring
appears bare of grass, surrounding the dark ring; but, after the fungi
have ceased to appear, the soil where they had grown becomes darker,
and the grass soon vegetates again with peculiar vigour. Dr. Wollaston
had many opportunities of remarking, that, when two circles interfere
with each other’s progress, they do not cross each other, but are
invariably obliterated between the points of contact. The exhaustion

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>In order to comprehend the nature of <i>reciprocated vibration</i>, or
<i>resonance</i>, let the reader keep in his remembrance the analogy
between musical vibration, and the oscillation of the pendulum, as
explained at page 275. If he well understands the phenomena of the
latter, he will readily comprehend those of the former. Galileo
observed that a heavy pendulum might be put in motion by the least
breath of the mouth, <i>provided the blasts were often repeated, and
made to keep time exactly with the vibrations of the pendulum</i>: from
the same sympathetic communication of vibrations will two pendulum
clocks fixed to the same wall, or two watches lying upon the same
table, take the same rate of going, though they would not agree with
one another if placed in separate apartments. Mr. Ellicot indeed
observed that the pendulum of one clock was even able to stop that of
the other; and that the stopped pendulum, after a certain time, would
resume its vibrations, and in its turn stop the vibrations of the
other. We have here a correct explanation of the phenomena of
<i>Resonance</i>; for the undulations excited by a vibratory body are
themselves capable of putting in motion all bodies whose pulses are
coincident
<span class='pageno' title='476' id='Page_476'></span>with their own, and consequently with those of the primitive sounding body;
hence the vibrations of a string, when another, tuned in unison with
it, is made to vibrate.</p>

<p class='c016'>Upon the same principle does the resonance, or reciprocated vibrations
of columns of air, depend. We are much indebted to Mr. Wheatstone for
our knowledge of this branch of acoustics; he has shown that, if a
tuning-fork or a bell be sounded before a tube inclosing a column of
air of the necessary length, the original sound will be augmented by
the rich resonance of that air; and that the sounds of tuning-forks,
if held before the cavity of the mouth, may be reciprocated most
intensely by adjusting the alterable volume of air contained within it
to the pitch of the instrument; by placing, for instance, the tongue,
&amp;c. in the position for the nasal continuous sound of <i>ng</i> (in song),
and then altering the aperture of the lips, until the loudest sound
was obtained, he readily accomplished his object.</p>

<p class='c016'>If two vibrating tuning-forks, differing in pitch, be held over a
closed tube, furnished with a moveable piston, either sound may be
made to predominate, by so altering the piston as to obtain the exact
column of air which will reciprocate the required sound. The same
result may be obtained by selecting two bottles (which may be tuned
with water) each corresponding to the sound of a different tuning
fork; on bringing both tuning-forks to the mouth of each bottle
alternately, that sound only will be heard, in each case, which is
reciprocated by the unisonant bottle; or, in other words, by that
bottle which contains a column of air susceptible of vibrating in
unison with the fork.</p>

<p class='c016'>Among the Javanese instruments brought to England by the late Sir
Stamford Raffles, there is one called the <i>gender</i>, in which the
resonances of columns of air are employed to augment, we might almost
say to render audible, the sounds of vibrating metallic plates. Under
each of these plates is placed an upright bamboo, containing a column
of air of the proper length to reciprocate the lowest sound of such
plate. If the aperture of the bamboo be covered with pasteboard, and
its corresponding plate be struck, a number of acute sounds only
(depending on the more numerous subdivisions of the plate) will be
heard; but, on removing the pasteboard, an additional deep rich tone
is produced by the resonance of the column of air within the tube.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is only by a knowledge of this principle that the
<span class='pageno' title='477' id='Page_477'></span>theory of the Guimbarde, or Jew’s harp, can be well understood.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The Memoires of Madame de Genlis first made known the astonishing
powers of a poor German soldier on the Jew’s harp. This musician was
in the service of Frederick the Great, and finding himself one night
on duty under the windows of the king, played the Jew’s harp with so
much skill, that Frederick, who was a great amateur of music, thought
he heard a distinct orchestra. Surprised on learning that such an
effect could be produced by a single man with two Jew’s harps, he
ordered him into his presence; the soldier refused, alleging that he
could only be relieved by his colonel; and that, if he obeyed, the
king would punish him the next day for having failed to do his duty.
Being presented the following morning to Frederick, he was heard with
admiration, and received his discharge and fifty dollars. This artist,
whose name Madame de Genlis does not mention, is called Koch; he has
not any knowledge of music, but owes his success entirely to a natural
taste. He has made his fortune by travelling about, and performing in
public and private; and is now living retired at Vienna, at the
advanced age of more than eighty years. He used two Jew’s harps at
once, in the same manner as the peasants of the Tyrol; and produced,
without doubt, the harmony of two notes struck at the same moment,
which was considered by the musically-curious as somewhat
extraordinary, when the limited powers of the instrument were
remembered. It was Koch’s custom to require that all the lights should
be extinguished, in order that the illusion produced by his playing
might be increased.</p>

<p class='c016'>It was reserved, however, for Mr. Eulenstein to acquire a musical
reputation from the Jew’s harp. After ten years of close application
and study, this young artist has attained a perfect mastery over this
untractable instrument. In giving some account of the Jew’s harp,
considered as a medium for musical sounds, we shall only present the
result of his discoveries. This little instrument, taken singly, gives
whatever grave sound you may wish to produce, as a <i>third</i>, a <i>fifth</i>,
or an <i>octave</i>. If the grave tonic is not heard in the bass Jew’s
harp, it must be
<span class='pageno' title='478' id='Page_478'></span>attributed not to the defectiveness of the instrument, but to the
player. In examining this result, you cannot help remarking the order
and unity established by nature in harmonical bodies, which places
music in the rank of exact sciences. The Jew’s harp has three
different tones; the bass tones of the first octave bear some
resemblance to those of the flute and clarionet; those of the middle
and high to the <i>vox humana</i> of some organs; lastly, the harmonical
sounds are exactly like those of the <i>harmonica</i>. It is conceived that
this diversity of tones affords already a great variety in the
execution, which is always looked upon as being feeble and trifling,
on account of the smallness of the instrument. It was not thought
possible to derive much pleasure from any attempt which could be made
to conquer the difficulties of so limited an instrument; because, in
the extent of these octaves, there were a number of spaces which could
not be filled up by the talent of the player; besides, the most simple
modulation became impossible. Mr. Eulenstein has remedied that
inconvenience, by joining sixteen Jew’s harps, which he tunes by
placing smaller or greater quantities of sealing-wax at the extremity
of the tongue. Each harp then sounds one of the notes of the gamut,
diatonic or chromatic; and the performer can fill all the intervals,
and pass all the tones, by changing the harp. That these mutations may
not interrupt the measure, one harp must always be kept in advance, in
the same manner as a good reader advances the eye, not upon the word
which he pronounces, but upon that which follows.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>This project has lately been revived; in a late number of the <i>Revue
Encyclopédique</i> there is a proposal to communicate verbal
intelligence, in a few moments, to vast distances; and this not by
symbols, as in the Telegraph, but in distinct articulate sounds
uttered by the human voice. The plan is said to have originated with
an Englishman, Mr. Dick, according to whose experiments the human
voice may be made intelligible at the distance of twenty-five or
thirty miles. It has been stated, in <a href='#note44'>Note 44</a>, that the celebrated Biot
had ascertained that sound travels more than ten times quicker when
transmitted by solid bodies, or through tubes, than when it passes
through the open air;
<span class='pageno' title='479' id='Page_479'></span>at the distance of more than half a mile the low voice of a man was
distinctly heard. Father Kircher relates in some of his works, that
the labourers employed in the subterranean aqueducts of Rome heard
each other at the distance of several miles. The note which follows
was published in the early edition of this work, before the subject
attracted any notice, or any railroad had been completed. It is
therefore reprinted without alteration.</p>

</div>

<p class='c016'>It has often occurred to the author of these pages, during his
reveries, that the means of conveying intelligence with immense
rapidity may be hereafter invented by the Electrician.--Should a
system of railways be established throughout the country, it might
lead to some expedient by which such a desideratum could be
accomplished through the medium of electrical discharges. Upon this
subject we have accidentally fallen upon a curious notice in Arthur
Young’s Travels in France (vol. i. p. 65). “M. Lomond has made a very
curious discovery in electricity; you write two or three words on a
paper, he takes it with him into his room, and there turns a machine
inclosed in a cylindrical case, at the top of which is an electrometer
of pith balls; by means of a wire, a connexion is made with a similar
cylinder and electrometer in a distant apartment, and his wife, by
remarking the corresponding motions of the balls, writes down the
words they indicate; from which it appears that he has formed an
<i>Alphabet of Motion</i>. As the length of the conducting wire makes no
difference in the effect, a correspondence might be carried on at any
distance, as, for example, within or without a besieged town; or for
purposes much more interesting and useful. Whatever the uses may be,
the invention is beautiful.”</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The <i>carrier</i> is a variety of the common domestic pigeon, and which,
from the superior attachment that it shows to its native place, is
employed in many countries as the most expeditious courier. The
letters are tied under its wing, it is let loose, and in a very short
space returns to the home it was brought from, with its advices. This
practice was much in vogue in the East; and at Scanderoon, till of
late
<span class='pageno' title='480' id='Page_480'></span>years, it was used on the arrival of a ship, to give the merchants at Aleppo
a more expeditious notice than could be done by any other means. In
our own country, these aerial messengers have been employed for a very
singular purpose, having been let loose at Tyburn at the moment the
fatal cart was drawn away, to notify to distant friends the departure
of the unhappy criminal.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the East, the use of these birds seems to have been greatly
improved, by having, if we may use the expression, relays of them
ready to spread intelligence to all parts of the country; thus it is
stated by Ariosto (canto 15), that the governor of Damiata circulated
the news of the death of Orrilo. “As soon as the commandant of Damiata
heard that Orrilo was dead, he let loose a pigeon, under whose wing he
had tied a letter. This fled to Cairo, from whence a second was
despatched to another place, as is usual; so that, in a very few
hours, all Egypt was acquainted with the death of Orrilo.”</p>

<p class='c016'>But the simple use of them was known in very early times. Anacreon
tells us (ode ix.) that he conveyed his billet-doux to Bathyllus by a
dove.</p>

<p class='c016'>Taurosthenes also, by means of a pigeon he had decked with purple,
sent advice to his father, who lived in the isle of Ægina, of his
victory in the olympic games, on the very day he had obtained it.<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c017'><sup>[86]</sup></a>
And, at the siege of Modena, Hirtius without, and Brutus within the
walls, kept, by the help of pigeons, a constant correspondence;
baffling every stratagem of the besieger, Antony, to intercept their
couriers. In the times of the crusades, there are many more instances
of these birds of peace being employed in the service of war:
Joinville relates one during the crusade of <i>Saint Louis</i>, and Tasso
another, during the siege of Jerusalem.--<i>Pennant’s British Zoology.</i></p>

<p class='c016'>The Dutch variety is the most valuable; a pair of the best kind being
worth from five to eight pounds. It is lighter than the English
pigeon, and flies nearly as fast again. It proceeds at the rate of 60
miles an hour, and has been known to complete a journey of 800 miles,
but this; it
<span class='pageno' title='481' id='Page_481'></span>is presumed, is not continuous, but assisted by occasional rest. The
bird learns but one lesson; it may carry from Antwerp to London, or to
any other place, but it will only pass between two such places. It
evidently travels by sight; when tossed, it circles, then rises in a
spiral, observes its route and darts off. It will not fly at night;
and, should the day be foggy, it is delayed, and sometimes lost.</p>

<p class='c016'>The soothsayers attributed many mystic properties to the coral; and it
was believed to be capable of giving protection against the influence
of <i>Evil Eyes</i>: it was even supposed that coral would drive away
devils and evil spirits; hence arose the custom of wearing amulets
composed of it around the neck, and of making crowns of it. Pliny and
Dioscorides are very loud in the praises of the medicinal properties
of this substance; and Paracelsus says that it should be worn round
the necks of infants, as an admirable preservative against fits,
sorcery, charms, and even against poison. It is a curious circumstance
that the same superstitious belief should exist among the negroes of
the West Indies, who affirm that the colour of coral is always
affected by the state of health of the wearer, it becoming paler in
disease. In Sicily it is also commonly worn as an amulet by persons of
all ranks; as a security against an <i>evil eye</i>, a small twisted piece,
somewhat resembling a horn, is worn at the watch-chain, under the name
of <i>Buon Fortuna</i>, and is occasionally pointed at those who are
supposed to entertain evil intention. His late Sicilian Majesty was
celebrated for his faith in, and frequent use of, the <i>buon
fortuna</i>.--But to return to the coral usually suspended around the
necks of children in our own country. In addition to the supposed
virtues of the coral, it may be remarked that silver bells are usually
attached to it, which are generally regarded as mere accompaniments to
amuse the child by their jingle; but the fact is, that they have a
different origin, having been designed to frighten away evil spirits.
For the same superstitious objects were bells introduced into our
churches as a species of charm against storms and thunder, and the
assaults of Satan.</p>

<p class='c016'>In farther illustration of the truth, that a custom has frequently
survived the tradition of its origin, it may be here observed, that
the common practice of persons who are
<span class='pageno' title='482' id='Page_482'></span>unable to write, making their mark or <i>cross</i>, is derived from our Saxon
ancestors, who affixed the sign of the cross, as a signature to a
deed, whether they could write or not. Several charters still remain,
to which kings and persons of great eminence affix “<i>Signum Crucis
manu propriá pro ignorantiá literarum</i>.” Hence is derived the
expression of <i>signing</i> instead of <i>subscribing</i> a paper. In like
manner, the physician of the present day continues to prefix to his
prescriptions the letter R, which is generally supposed to mean
<i>Recipe</i>, but which, in truth, is a relict of the astrological symbol
of Jupiter, formerly used as a species of superstitious invocation.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Alphesadi, an Arabian writer, quoted by Montucla in his <i>Histoire des
Mathematiques</i>, expressly mentions the invention of chess as of Indian
origin, and relates the following very curious Indian
tradition:--Ardschir, King of the Persians, having invented the game
of <i>Tric-Trac</i>, and being exceedingly vain of it, a certain Indian,
named Sessa, the son of Daher, invented the game of chess, and
presented his chess-board and chess-men to the king of the Indies. The
sovereign was so much pleased, that he desired Sessa to name his
reward, when this man made the apparently modest request, that he
should receive as a gift so much corn as could be estimated by
beginning with one grain, and doubling as many times as there were
squares upon the chess-board, viz. 64. The king felt displeased at
having his munificence thus slighted by a request so limited and so
unworthy to be a gift from royalty; but, as Sessa remained firm,
orders were given to the chief minister that he should be satisfied:
when, however, the visir had by calculation ascertained the enormous
quantity of corn which would be required, he waited upon the king, and
with some difficulty convinced him of the fact; upon which the king
sent for Sessa,--and said to him, that he admired his powers of
calculation even more than the ingenuity of the game which he had
presented to him, and, in respect to his promise as to the corn, he
was compelled to acknowledge himself to be insolvent.</p>

<p class='c016'>Dr. Wallis, the friend of Sir Isaac Newton, and Savilian Professor of
Oxford, found that the quantity of corn would be such as to be capable
of forming a pyramid, the measurement
<span class='pageno' title='483' id='Page_483'></span>of which would be nine English miles in height, and nine similar miles
for each of the four sides of the base. After this, Montucla also
states some elaborate calculations made by himself, and proves,
amongst other remarkable facts, that the quantity of corn in question
would cover 162,000 square leagues to the depth of one foot, French
measure, which would be at least three times the extent of the surface
of France as it was about the year 1796, and which he estimates at
50,000 square leagues.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>This problem is to be found in Hutton’s Recreations, and is stated as
follows:--</p>

<p class='c016'>“A person having in one hand an <i>even</i> number of shillings, and in the
other an <i>odd</i>, to tell in which hand he has the even number.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Desire the person to multiply the number in the right hand by any
even number whatever, and that in the left by any odd number; then bid
him to add together the two products, and if the whole sum be odd, the
even number of shillings will be in the right hand, and the odd number
in the left; if the sum be even, the contrary will be the case. By a
similar process, a person having in one hand a piece of gold, and in
the other a piece of silver, we can tell in which hand he holds the
gold, and in which the silver. For this purpose, some value
represented by an even number, such as 8, must be assigned to the
gold, and a value represented by an odd number, such as 3, must be
assigned to the silver; after which the operation is exactly the same
as in the preceding example.</p>

<p class='c016'>“To conceal the artifice better, it will be sufficient to ask whether
the sum of the two products can be halved without a remainder; for, in
that case, the total will be even, and in the contrary case odd.</p>

<p class='c016'>“It will be readily seen that the pieces, instead of being in the two
hands of the same person, may be supposed to be in the hands of two
persons, one of whom has the even number, or piece of gold, and the
other the odd number, or piece of silver. The same operations may then
be performed in regard to these two persons, as are performed in
regard to the two hands of the same person, calling the one,
privately, the right, and the other the left.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' title='484' id='Page_484'></span>It is by discovering the number of counters left on the board that
this trick is performed. By means of a table the problem may be
immediately solved; but as such a reference would be inconvenient,
and, indeed, destructive to the magic of the trick, a Latin verse is
substituted, which may be easily carried in the memory, and will be
found to answer all the purposes of a table. In order, however, that
the reader may become thoroughly acquainted with the machinery of the
trick, we shall explain it in the words of its author. The problem is
stated as follows: “<i>Three things being privately distributed to three
persons, to guess that which each has got.</i>”</p>

<p class='c016'>Let the three things be a ring, a shilling, and a glove. Call the ring
<b><span class='fss'>A</span></b>, the shilling <b><span class='fss'>E</span></b>, and the glove <b><span class='fss'>I</span></b>; and in your own mind distinguish
the persons by calling them first, second, and third. Then take
twenty-four counters, and give one of them to the first person, two to
the second, and three to the third. Place the remaining eighteen on
the table, and then retire, that the three persons may distribute
among themselves the three things proposed without your observing
them. When the distribution has been made, desire the person who has
the ring to take from the remaining eighteen counters as many as he
has already; the one who has the shilling to take twice as many as he
has already, and the person who has the glove to take four times as
many; according to the above supposition then, the first person has
taken one, the second four, and the third twelve; consequently, one
counter only remains on the table. When this is done, you may return,
and, by the number left, can discover what thing each person has
taken, by employing the following words:----</p>

must likewise be observed, that each syllable contains one of the
vowels, which we have made to represent the things proposed, and that
the first syllable of each word must be considered as representing the
first person, and the second syllable the second. This being
comprehended, if there remains only one counter, you must
<span class='pageno' title='485' id='Page_485'></span>employ the first word, or rather the two first syllables, <i>sal-ve</i>, the first
of which, that containing <b><span class='fss'>A</span></b>, shows that the first person has the ring
represented by <b><span class='fss'>A</span></b>; and the second syllable, that containing <b><span class='fss'>E</span></b>, shows
that the second person has the shilling represented by <b><span class='fss'>E</span></b>; from which
you may easily conclude that the third person has the glove. If two
counters should remain, you must take the second word <i>cer-ta</i>, the
first syllable of which, containing <b><span class='fss'>E</span></b>, will show that the first person
has the shilling represented by <b><span class='fss'>E</span></b>; and the second syllable, containing
<b><span class='fss'>A</span></b>, will indicate that the second person has the ring represented by <b><span class='fss'>A</span></b>.
